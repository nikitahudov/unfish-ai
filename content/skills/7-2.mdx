## Introduction

Here's a secret most poker players ignore: **where you play matters as much as how you play.**

You could be the 10th best player in the world, but if you only play against the top 9, you're a loser. Conversely, an average player at a table full of beginners prints money.

<KeyConcept title="The Table Selection Edge">
**Table selection can double your win rate.**

Consider two scenarios:
- **Table A:** Five solid regulars, one recreational player. Your edge: 2bb/100
- **Table B:** Two regulars, four recreational players. Your edge: 8bb/100

Same skill. Same stakes. **4x the profit at Table B.**

Time is finite. Spend it in the most profitable games.
</KeyConcept>

This module teaches you how to identify profitable tables, avoid tough ones, and know when to leave.

## The Math of Table Selection

Your profit comes from players worse than you. Let's quantify this.

### The "Fish in a Barrel" Concept

At any table, you make money from:
- Players who make more mistakes than you
- Players who play too many hands
- Players who call too much
- Players who don't adjust to you

**One recreational player at a table can make it highly profitable.**

Even if the other 5 players are solid, that one fish provides most of your edge.

### Opportunity Cost

Every hour you spend at a tough table is an hour not spent at a soft table.

**Example:**
- Tough table: 2bb/100 win rate
- Soft table available: 8bb/100 win rate
- Opportunity cost: 6bb/100

Over a 1,000 hand session, that's 60 big blinds left on the table. At NL100, that's $60.

<Exercise
  question="You're winning 3bb/100 at your current table. You notice a table with 4 recreational players where you'd likely win 10bb/100. Should you move?"
  type="text"
  answer="yes"
  acceptableAnswers={["yes", "Yes", "YES", "move"]}
  hint="Compare the win rates"
  explanation="Yes, move! The difference is 7bb/100. Over 500 hands, that's 35bb extra profit. Unless there's a specific reason to stay (like a whale about to reload at your current table), take the better game."

## Profitable Table Indicators

Learn to spot soft tables quickly:

<FlashCards
  title="Signs of a Profitable Table"
  cards={[
    { front: "High average pot size", back: "Bigger pots = more action = weaker players. Tight regs create small pots." },
    { front: "High players-per-flop %", back: "More players seeing flops = loose = profitable. Look for 30%+ in full ring." },
    { front: "Frequent limping", back: "Limping is a weak player tell. Multiple limpers = multiple fish." },
    { front: "Short stacks (30-50bb)", back: "Often recreational players or scared money. Easy to outplay." },
    { front: "Odd stack sizes (e.g., $47.32)", back: "Result of losing hands, not buying in fresh. Often tilted or recreational." },
    { front: "Evening/weekend times", back: "Recreational players play after work/weekends. Best times for soft games." },
    { front: "Active chat/banter", back: "Social players are often recreational. Quiet tables = focused regs." },
    { front: "Players on phone/distracted", back: "Not paying full attention = weaker play. Free money." }
  ]}
/>

### Online Lobby Statistics

Most poker sites show helpful stats in the lobby:

| Stat | What to Look For |
|------|------------------|
| **Avg Pot** | Higher = softer (NL100: look for $40+) |
| **Players/Flop %** | Higher = softer (look for 25%+) |
| **Hands/Hour** | Lower sometimes = recreational pace |
| **Wait List** | Good games have waiting lists |

<Exercise
  question="Two NL50 tables: Table A shows 18% players/flop and $8 avg pot. Table B shows 35% players/flop and $22 avg pot. Which is likely softer?"
  type="text"
  answer="Table B"
  acceptableAnswers={["Table B", "B", "table B"]}
  hint="Compare the numbers"
  explanation="Table B is much softer. 35% players/flop vs 18% means much looser players. $22 avg pot vs $8 means bigger action. Table A is a tight reg table; Table B has fish."
/>

## Warning Signs: Tables to Avoid

Know when to stay away:

### Red Flags

**All similar stack sizes (100bb each):**
Everyone bought in for the maximum and hasn't lost or won. This screams "regular grinders."

**Very low average pot size:**
Tight players making small pots. No value to extract.

**Multiple HUD users visible:**
If you can see HUDs on many players, you're at a reg table.

**High hands/hour + low pot size:**
Fast-paced grinding by regulars who fold a lot.

**Names you recognize:**
If you know multiple players as good regulars, find another table.

**No waiting list:**
At peak hours, good games have waiting lists. Empty seats often mean it's a tough table.

<KeyConcept title="The Reg Table Warning">
**How to spot a reg table:**

- All 100bb stacks
- Average pot under 15bb
- Less than 20% players per flop
- Everyone playing silently
- Hands folding preflop frequently

**Leave immediately.** These tables exist so regs can battle each other for tiny edges while rake eats everyone's profit.
</KeyConcept>

<Exercise
  question="A table has 6 players, all with exactly 100bb stacks, 15% players/flop, and average pot of $6 at NL100. Should you sit?"
  type="text"
  answer="no"
  acceptableAnswers={["no", "No", "NO", "avoid", "skip"]}
  hint="Check the warning signs"
  explanation="Hard no. All 100bb stacks (regs), 15% players/flop (very tight), $6 avg pot at NL100 (tiny pots). This is a reg battle. You'd be fighting for scraps while paying rake. Find a better game."

## Online Table Selection Strategy

<KeyConcept title="Online Selection Routine">
**Step 1: Check the lobby**
- Sort by average pot or players/flop
- Look for tables with 25%+ players/flop

**Step 2: Use waiting lists**
- Join wait lists for good tables
- You can be on multiple lists

**Step 3: Table starting**
- Be the first to sit at new tables
- Fish often join new tables (fewer players = less intimidating)

**Step 4: Monitor constantly**
- Check lobby every 10-15 minutes
- Better games might appear
- Your current game might have changed

**Step 5: Be willing to move**
- Don't stay at a bad table out of laziness
- Open multiple tables to have options
</KeyConcept>

### Multi-Tabling Considerations

If you multi-table:
- Prioritize quality over quantity
- Better to have 3 great tables than 6 mediocre ones
- Keep one eye on lobby for upgrades
- Drop bad tables as you find better ones

<Exercise
  question="You're 4-tabling and one table has become reg-heavy (the fish left). What should you do?"
  type="text"
  answer="Close that table and find a better one"
  acceptableAnswers={["close it", "leave", "find better table", "close and find new", "leave the table"]}
  hint="Why stay at a bad table?"
  explanation="Close it and find a better game. There's no rule saying you must keep 4 tables. Three good tables beat 4 mediocre ones. Constantly upgrade your table portfolio."
/>

## Live Table Selection

Live poker requires different tactics:

### Before You Sit

**Scout the room:**
Walk around before putting your name on a list. Watch for:
- Tables with lots of laughing/talking
- Big chip stacks (someone's winning; someone's losing)
- Drinking and social behavior
- Short stacks (scared money or bad players reloading)

**Ask the floor:**
"Which tables have the most action?" Floor staff often know which games are soft.

**Watch for 10-15 minutes:**
If possible, observe a table before sitting. You'll learn more in 10 minutes of watching than 30 minutes of playing.

### Time of Day Patterns

| Time | Game Quality |
|------|--------------|
| Morning (before noon) | Often regs/grinders, tough |
| Afternoon | Mixed, depends on day |
| Evening (6-10pm) | Softest—after-work crowd |
| Late night (after midnight) | Drunk players, but also tired grinders |
| Weekends | Softer overall, more recs |
| Major events (sports, holidays) | Casino-goers = soft games |

<Exercise
  question="It's Friday at 8pm. You have the choice between a table that's been running since 9am and a table that just started. Which is likely softer?"
  type="text"
  answer="The table that just started"
  acceptableAnswers={["just started", "new table", "newer table"]}
  hint="Who plays poker for 11+ hours on a Friday?"
  explanation="The new table is likely softer. The table running since 9am is full of dedicated grinders. The new table at 8pm on Friday will attract the fresh after-work recreational crowd."
/>

## Seat Selection Within a Table

Once you've chosen a table, seat selection matters too.

<Comparison
  title="Who You Want Where"
  left={{
    title: "On Your RIGHT (They Act Before You)",
    items: [
      "Aggressive players (LAGs, Maniacs)",
      "Big stacks",
      "Players who raise a lot",
      "Anyone you want position on"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "On Your LEFT (They Act After You)",
    items: [
      "Passive/weak players",
      "Calling stations",
      "Tight players (they fold to you)",
      "Anyone you can push around"
    ]
  }}
/>

### The Ideal Seat

**Best case:** Fish on your right, tight/passive players on your left.

- You have position on the fish (can isolate, value bet, control pots)
- The players who act after you are unlikely to 3-bet or cause problems

### Seat Change Requests

In live poker, you can request seat changes:
- Ask the floor for a specific seat
- Wait for a better seat to open
- Move when the fish gets up

In online poker:
- Join waiting lists for specific seats
- Some sites allow seat preferences

<Exercise
  question="There's a maniac at seat 4 and a calling station at seat 8. You're choosing between seat 3 and seat 7. Which is better?"
  type="text"
  answer="Seat 7"
  acceptableAnswers={["Seat 7", "seat 7", "7"]}
  hint="You want the maniac on your right and the station on your left"
  explanation="Seat 7. This puts the maniac (seat 4) on your RIGHT (you act after them) and the calling station (seat 8) on your LEFT. You have position on the aggressive player and can isolate them. The station acting after you is fine—they're passive."
/>

## When to Leave a Table

Knowing when to leave is as important as knowing where to sit.

### Leave When:

**The fish left:**
If the recreational player(s) leave and you're now at a reg table, find a better game.

**Table composition changed:**
Even if no one left, if tight players replaced loose players, the dynamic shifted.

**You're tilting:**
Better games exist when you're playing well. Don't compound tilt with bad game selection.

**You're tired:**
Tired players make mistakes. Leave before you become the fish.

**A better game is available:**
Check the lobby. If there's a significantly better option, move.

### Don't Leave Because:

**You're losing:**
Results don't determine table quality. If the game is still good, stay.

**Of sunk cost:**
"I've been here 2 hours" doesn't matter. The question is: "Is this the best game right now?"

**Of ego:**
"I can beat these regs" might be true, but why fight hard for small edges when easy money exists elsewhere?

<Exercise
  question="You've been at a great table for 3 hours. The two recreational players just left. You're down 2 buy-ins. Should you stay?"
  type="text"
  answer="no - leave and find better game"
  acceptableAnswers={["no", "leave", "No", "find better game"]}
  hint="Why was the table great?"
  explanation="Leave. The table was great because of the recreational players—they're gone. Being down 2 buy-ins is irrelevant to table selection. Find a new table with fish. Don't stay in a reg game hoping to 'get even.'"
/>

## Table Selection Routine

<KeyConcept title="Your Pre-Session Checklist">
**Before playing:**
1. Spend 5-10 minutes on table selection (not just clicking first open seat)
2. Check lobby stats for all tables at your stake
3. Identify 2-3 best options
4. Join waiting lists if needed

**During session:**
1. Check lobby every 15-20 minutes
2. Monitor your table quality (did fish leave?)
3. Be ready to move if better options appear

**Continuous improvement:**
1. Track which tables/times are most profitable
2. Note player names you want to play with
3. Build a list of players to avoid

**Never:**
- Sit at first available seat without checking
- Stay at a reg table out of laziness
- Ignore changes in table composition
</KeyConcept>

## Practice: Evaluate These Tables

<MultiExercise
  title="Table Selection Decisions"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "Table A: 32% players/flop, $28 avg pot, 4 players with odd stack sizes. Table B: 19% players/flop, $11 avg pot, all 100bb stacks. Which do you choose?",
      answer: "Table A",
      explanation: "Table A easily. Higher players/flop (32% vs 19%), bigger pots ($28 vs $11), and odd stack sizes suggest recreational players who've been winning/losing. Table B is a reg table."
    },
    {
      question: "It's Tuesday at 10am. The lobby shows one NL50 table running. Should you sit?",
      answer: "Check the stats first, but likely tough game",
      explanation: "Be cautious. Tuesday morning is typically when only dedicated grinders play. Check the lobby stats—if it's showing tight metrics, skip it or play shorter session. Better games will appear in the evening."
    },
    {
      question: "You're at a great table but seat 2 (tight nit) leaves and seat 2 is taken by a known LAG regular. Table still has two fish. Should you stay?",
      answer: "Stay but monitor",
      explanation: "Stay for now—two fish still make it profitable. But monitor the LAG. If they're making your life difficult (constantly 3-betting you), consider moving. Having one tough reg doesn't ruin a fishy table."
    },
    {
      question: "There's a 10-person waiting list for a juicy-looking table. Should you wait?",
      answer: "Yes, and play another table while waiting",
      explanation: "Yes! A 10-person waitlist confirms the game is good—everyone wants in. Put your name on the list and play another table while you wait. When your name comes up, evaluate both games."
    },
    {
      question: "You've been playing 4 hours. Two fish left an hour ago, but you're on a heater and up 3 buy-ins. Should you stay?",
      answer: "No - being up doesn't make the game good",
      explanation: "Leave. Being up 3 buy-ins is great, but the fish left an hour ago. You've been playing a reg table for an hour—that's an hour of smaller win rate. Your hot streak could have been even hotter at a softer table."
    }

## Scenario: Choosing Where to Sit

<Scenario
  title="Friday Night Table Hunt"
  setup="It's Friday at 7pm. You're looking for a good NL100 game online. Let's walk through your table selection process."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "You open the lobby and sort by average pot. Top three tables show: $42, $38, and $18. Which do you investigate first?",
      answer: "$42 average pot table",
      hint: "Bigger pots often indicate looser play",
      explanation: "The $42 table first. Larger average pot size typically indicates more action and looser players. Check the players/flop % next to confirm it's not just one big pot skewing the average."
    },
    {
      question: "The $42 table shows 28% players/flop and has two players with stacks of $147 and $63. The $38 table shows 22% players/flop and all 100bb stacks. Which do you choose?",
      answer: "$42 table",
      hint: "What do the odd stack sizes suggest?",
      explanation: "The $42 table. Higher players/flop (28% vs 22%) and odd stack sizes ($147, $63) suggest recreational players who've been playing a while. The $38 table with all 100bb stacks is likely more regular-heavy."
    },
    {
      question: "You sit at the $42 table. There's one open seat (seat 3) and the fishiest player (based on quick observation) is in seat 5. Is seat 3 good?",
      answer: "Yes - fish is on your right",
      hint: "Where is seat 5 relative to seat 3?",
      explanation: "Yes! Seat 5 is to your right at seat 3, meaning you'll act after them. You have direct position on the fish—ideal for isolating and value betting."
    },
    {
      question: "One hour later, the fish from seat 5 leaves. The lobby shows another table with 35% players/flop. What do you do?",
      answer: "Move to the new table",
      hint: "Why was this table good?",
      explanation: "Move to the new table. Your current table lost its primary value (the fish). The new table shows even better metrics (35% players/flop). Don't be lazy—follow the good games."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Summary

<KeyConcept title="Key Takeaways">
1. **Table selection can double your win rate** — Choose games wisely
2. **Look for high players/flop and avg pot** — Loose players = profit
3. **Avoid reg tables** — All 100bb stacks + tight metrics = leave
4. **Seat selection matters** — Position on fish and LAGs on your right
5. **Monitor constantly** — Check lobby, be ready to move
6. **Leave when fish leave** — The game you sat in may not be today's game
7. **Time matters** — Evenings and weekends are softest
8. **Don't stay for sunk cost** — Best game right now, not where you've been
</KeyConcept>

Table selection is one of the highest-ROI skills in poker. Five minutes of smart selection can add more to your win rate than hours of study. Make it a habit, not an afterthought.
