## Introduction

You've learned the math—pot odds and equity. Now it's time to apply that knowledge to the most common decision in poker: **should I play this hand?**

Every orbit, you're dealt two cards. Most of the time, the correct decision is simple: **fold**. The art of poker starts with knowing which hands deserve your chips and which ones belong in the muck.

<KeyConcept title="The Foundation of Winning Poker">
**Tight is right for beginners.** Playing fewer, stronger hands is the fastest path to profitability.

Every hand you play costs money (blinds, rake, mistakes). Only enter pots when your hand gives you an edge.
</KeyConcept>

Starting hand selection isn't glamorous. You won't see it highlighted in poker broadcasts. But ask any professional what separates winners from losers at low stakes, and they'll tell you: hand selection discipline.

## The 169 Starting Hands

In Texas Hold'em, there are exactly **169 unique starting hand combinations**:

- **13 pocket pairs** (AA, KK, QQ... down to 22)
- **78 suited combinations** (AKs, AQs, all the way to 32s)
- **78 offsuit combinations** (AKo, AQo, all the way to 32o)

These 169 hands represent all possible starting situations. Some are gold, most are garbage, and a few are deceptively dangerous.

<Exercise
  question="How many unique starting hand types are there in Hold'em?"
  type="number"
  answer={169}
  acceptableRange={[169, 169]}
  hint="Count pairs + suited combos + offsuit combos"
  explanation="169 unique hands: 13 pairs + 78 suited hands + 78 offsuit hands = 169. Note: there are 1,326 actual combinations, but 169 unique types."
/>

### The Hand Matrix

Poker players visualize starting hands on a 13x13 grid called the **hand matrix**:

```
    A   K   Q   J   T   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2
A  AA  AKs AQs AJs ATs A9s A8s A7s A6s A5s A4s A3s A2s
K  AKo KK  KQs KJs KTs K9s K8s K7s K6s K5s K4s K3s K2s
Q  AQo KQo QQ  QJs QTs Q9s Q8s Q7s Q6s Q5s Q4s Q3s Q2s
J  AJo KJo QJo JJ  JTs J9s J8s J7s J6s J5s J4s J3s J2s
T  ATo KTo QTo JTo TT  T9s T8s T7s T6s T5s T4s T3s T2s
9  A9o K9o Q9o J9o T9o 99  98s 97s 96s 95s 94s 93s 92s
8  A8o K8o Q8o J8o T8o 98o 88  87s 86s 85s 84s 83s 82s
7  A7o K7o Q7o J7o T7o 97o 87o 77  76s 75s 74s 73s 72s
6  A6o K6o Q6o J6o T6o 96o 86o 76o 66  65s 64s 63s 62s
5  A5o K5o Q5o J5o T5o 95o 85o 75o 65o 55  54s 53s 52s
4  A4o K4o Q4o J4o T4o 94o 84o 74o 64o 54o 44  43s 42s
3  A3o K3o Q3o J3o T3o 93o 83o 73o 63o 53o 43o 33  32s
2  A2o K2o Q2o J2o T2o 92o 82o 72o 62o 52o 42o 32o 22
```

- **Diagonal** = Pocket pairs
- **Above diagonal** = Suited hands
- **Below diagonal** = Offsuit hands

## Hand Categories

Let's organize all 169 hands into categories based on playability:

### Tier 1: Premium Hands

These hands are **always playable** from any position:

**AA, KK, QQ** — The powerhouses. You'll build big pots and usually have the best hand.

**AKs** — "Big Slick" suited. Best unpaired hand, plays well postflop.

<KeyConcept title="Premium Hands">
Premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AKs) make up only **2.6%** of all hands dealt.

When you have one, your goal is to build the pot preflop. These hands are too strong to slow-play before the flop.
</KeyConcept>

### Tier 2: Strong Hands

Highly playable from most positions:

**JJ, TT** — Strong pairs, but vulnerable to overcards on the flop.

**AKo, AQs, AQo, AJs** — Big broadway hands that make strong top pairs.

**KQs** — Suited broadway with straight and flush potential.

### Tier 3: Medium Pairs and Strong Broadways

Playable from middle-to-late position:

**99, 88, 77** — Medium pairs. Great for set-mining.

**ATs, KQo, KJs, QJs** — Broadway hands with decent playability.

### Tier 4: Speculative Hands

Playable in the right conditions (late position, deep stacks, multiway pots):

**66, 55, 44, 33, 22** — Small pairs. Live to flop a set.

**Suited connectors:** JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s, 65s — Make straights and flushes.

**Suited aces:** A5s, A4s, A3s, A2s — Nut flush potential and some straight possibilities.

### Tier 5: Trouble Hands

**Look stronger than they are. Proceed with caution:**

**KJo, KTo, QJo, QTo, JTo** — These hands flop top pair with a bad kicker or second pair frequently. They're often dominated.

**AJo, ATo** — Better than KJ/QJ but still risky against aggressive opponents.

<Exercise
  question="Which tier does JJ belong to?"
  type="text"
  answer="Tier 2"
  acceptableAnswers={["Tier 2", "tier 2", "2", "Strong Hands", "strong hands"]}
  hint="JJ is strong but not quite premium"
  explanation="JJ is a Tier 2 (Strong) hand. It's excellent preflop but vulnerable to overcards on the flop, making it slightly below the premium tier."
/>

<Exercise
  question="Is KJo a premium hand, strong hand, or trouble hand?"
  type="text"
  answer="trouble hand"
  acceptableAnswers={["trouble hand", "Trouble hand", "trouble", "Trouble", "Tier 5"]}
  hint="How does KJ perform when you flop a king?"
  explanation="KJo is a trouble hand. When you flop a king, you have a weak kicker and are often dominated by KQ or AK. It looks better than it plays."
/>

## Hand Strength Is Relative

Here's what separates good players from beginners: understanding that hand strength depends entirely on **context**.

### Position Impact

The same hand can be a clear raise from the button and a clear fold from under-the-gun. Why?

- **More hands to act behind** = more chance someone has you beat
- **Worse position postflop** = harder to realize equity

<Comparison
  title="Same Hand, Different Positions"
  left={{
    title: "K9s Under-the-Gun",
    items: [
      "7-8 players to act behind",
      "Likely facing 3-bet with weak hand",
      "Out of position vs most callers",
      "Verdict: FOLD"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "K9s on the Button",
    items: [
      "Only 2 players (blinds) to act",
      "Likely to take pot uncontested",
      "Always in position postflop",
      "Verdict: RAISE"
    ]
  }}
/>

### Number of Opponents

**Heads-up pots:** High card strength matters. AK is great.

**Multiway pots:** Drawing hands improve. Suited connectors gain value; bare high cards decrease.

Why? In multiway pots, someone is more likely to hit the flop hard. Top pair becomes less reliable; straights and flushes become more valuable.

### Stack Depth

**Short stacks (under 30bb):** High card hands increase in value. You're often getting it in preflop or on the flop.

**Deep stacks (100bb+):** Speculative hands improve. Small pairs and suited connectors can win massive pots when they hit big hands.

<Exercise
  question="With 150bb effective stacks, would you rather have 77 or AJo for an all-in preflop situation?"
  type="text"
  answer="AJo"
  acceptableAnswers={["AJo", "AJ", "ace jack"]}
  hint="Think about what happens when the money goes in preflop"
  explanation="AJo is better all-in preflop—it has more high card equity against random hands. However, for normal postflop play at 150bb, 77 would often be preferred because set potential is massive when deep."
/>

---

## Speculative Hands Deep Dive

Speculative hands are hands that usually miss but win big when they hit. Understanding when to play them is crucial.

### Small Pocket Pairs (22-66)

**The goal:** Flop a set (three of a kind).

**The math:** You'll flop a set about 12% of the time (roughly 1 in 8).

**The requirement:** You need **implied odds** of about 15:1 to profitably set-mine. This means:
- If you call a 3bb raise, you need to win 45bb when you hit
- Realistically, you need 75bb+ effective stacks

<KeyConcept title="Set Mining Math">
**Set probability:** ~12% (1 in 8 flops)

**Required implied odds:** ~15:1 to profit long-term

If effective stacks are below 50bb, set-mining becomes unprofitable against most bet sizes. Fold small pairs or only play them if you can see a cheap flop.
</KeyConcept>

### Suited Connectors (JTs, 98s, 76s, etc.)

**The goal:** Make straights, flushes, and two pairs.

**Best conditions:**
- Position (preferably button or cutoff)
- Multiway pots (more people = bigger implied odds)
- Deep stacks (need room to realize potential)

**Worst conditions:**
- Out of position
- Heads-up against aggressive player
- Short stacks

<Exercise
  question="You have 54s in the big blind. The button raises, and you have 25bb. Should you typically call or fold?"
  type="text"
  answer="fold"
  acceptableAnswers={["fold", "Fold", "FOLD"]}
  hint="Consider stack depth and position"
  explanation="Fold. At 25bb, you're too shallow to realize the speculative value of 54s. You'll miss most flops and can't profitably call bets. Suited connectors need deeper stacks to profit."
/>

### Suited Aces (A2s-A5s)

**The goal:** Make nut flushes and occasional straights.

**Value:** When you make a flush with a suited ace, you have the **nuts**. This means maximum extraction against other flushes.

**Danger:** Don't overvalue flopping an ace. A5s flopping ace-high is a weak pair, not a value hand.

## Trouble Hands Explained

<KeyConcept title="What Makes a Hand 'Trouble'?">
Trouble hands have two characteristics:
1. **They hit top pair with weak kickers** — Leading to second-best hands
2. **They're easily dominated** — KJ loses big to AK, KQ, AA, KK

The problem isn't that these hands lose—it's HOW they lose. They make expensive second-best hands.
</KeyConcept>

### The KJ Problem

You have K♠J♥ and the flop comes K♦8♣3♠.

**You think:** "Great, I flopped top pair!"

**Reality:** Any opponent with AK, KQ, or AA/KK has you crushed. You have a dominated kicker.

Now you face bets on three streets. Do you fold top pair? Call and lose big? You're in no-man's land.

### Reverse Implied Odds

Trouble hands have **reverse implied odds**—when you make your hand, you often lose even more money.

<Comparison
  title="Implied Odds vs. Reverse Implied Odds"
  left={{
    title: "Good Implied Odds",
    items: [
      "Small pair → flop a set",
      "Suited connector → hit a straight",
      "When you hit, opponent often has second-best",
      "You win big pots"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "Reverse Implied Odds",
    items: [
      "KJ → flop a king",
      "Your pair is often second-best",
      "When you hit, opponent may have better",
      "You lose big pots"
    ]
  }}
/>

<Exercise
  question="You have QJo and flop top pair on a Q-7-2 board. An opponent who raised preflop bets. What's your main concern?"
  type="text"
  answer="domination"
  acceptableAnswers={["domination", "Domination", "dominated", "AQ", "KQ", "kicker", "Kicker"]}
  hint="What hands would a preflop raiser have that beat you?"
  explanation="You should be concerned about domination. A preflop raiser likely has AQ or KQ in their range, both of which have you crushed. QJo flopping top pair is exactly the trouble scenario."
/>

## Game Type Adjustments

<FlashCards
  title="Adjustments by Game Type"
  cards={[
    { front: "6-max vs 9-max", back: "Play 15-20% more hands in 6-max. Fewer players = more stealing opportunities." },
    { front: "Cash vs Tournament (early)", back: "Play slightly tighter early in tournaments. Chips are more valuable; avoid marginal spots." },
    { front: "Cash vs Tournament (late/short)", back: "Play much wider when short-stacked. Any ace or king becomes shove-worthy." },
    { front: "Loose Table", back: "Tighten up. Let bad players pay you off with premium hands." },
    { front: "Tight Table", back: "Widen range. Steal blinds more frequently with marginal hands." },
    { front: "Aggressive Table", back: "Tighten up and 3-bet more with premiums. Avoid speculative hands." },
    { front: "Passive Table", back: "Play more speculative hands. See cheap flops and get paid when you hit." }
  ]}
/>

<Exercise
  question="At a loose-passive table where 5 players see most flops, should you play more speculative hands or more high-card hands?"
  type="text"
  answer="speculative hands"
  acceptableAnswers={["speculative hands", "speculative", "Speculative", "suited connectors", "small pairs"]}
  hint="What type of hands benefit from multiway pots with passive players?"
  explanation="Play more speculative hands! At loose-passive tables, you'll see cheap flops multiway. Small pairs and suited connectors have great implied odds because passive players will pay off your big hands."

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Playing Any Ace

A9o, A8o, A7o... these are usually folds. When you hit an ace, you often have kicker problems. When you miss, you have nothing.

### Mistake 2: Overvaluing Suited Cards

K5s is not a good hand. Being suited adds about 3-4% equity, but that doesn't turn trash into treasure.

### Mistake 3: Playing Too Many Hands Out of Position

"But I had odds to call!" You have reverse implied odds. You'll make expensive mistakes postflop.

### Mistake 4: Never Folding Pairs

22 is not playable from every position at every stack depth. Sometimes pocket pairs are folds.

## Practice: Categorize These Hands

<MultiExercise
  title="Hand Classification Practice"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "AKo — Premium, Strong, Medium, Speculative, or Trouble?",
      answer: "Strong",
      explanation: "AKo is a Strong (Tier 2) hand. It's excellent but just slightly below the suited version and premium pairs."
    },
    {
      question: "77 — Premium, Strong, Medium, Speculative, or Trouble?",
      answer: "Medium",
      explanation: "77 is a Medium (Tier 3) hand. It's a solid pair but vulnerable to overcards and needs set potential to justify calling raises."
    },
    {
      question: "KTo — Premium, Strong, Medium, Speculative, or Trouble?",
      answer: "Trouble",
      explanation: "KTo is a Trouble (Tier 5) hand. It looks playable but often makes dominated pairs. Be very cautious."
    },
    {
      question: "87s — Premium, Strong, Medium, Speculative, or Trouble?",
      answer: "Speculative",
      explanation: "87s is Speculative (Tier 4). It needs the right conditions (position, stack depth) but can make powerful hands."
    },
    {
      question: "QQ — Premium, Strong, Medium, Speculative, or Trouble?",
      answer: "Premium",
      explanation: "QQ is Premium (Tier 1). It's the third-best starting hand and should be played aggressively preflop."
    }

## Scenario: Should You Play This Hand?

<Scenario
  title="UTG Decisions"
  setup="You're playing a 6-max cash game with 100bb effective stacks. You're under-the-gun (first to act), and five players remain behind you. Consider whether to play each hand."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "You look down at JJ. Should you raise, call, or fold?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "JJ is a strong hand. What's the standard action with strong hands?",
      explanation: "Raise! JJ is a Tier 2 hand, easily strong enough to open from any position. Standard sizing: 2.5-3bb."
    },
    {
      question: "Next hand you have K9s. Should you raise, limp, or fold?",
      answer: "fold",
      hint: "K9s from UTG with 5 players behind... how often will you have the best hand?",
      explanation: "Fold. K9s is too weak from UTG. You'll face 3-bets with a dominated hand and play postflop out of position. Wait for a better spot."
    },
    {
      question: "Now you have AQo. Raise, call, or fold?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "AQo is much stronger than K9s. Where does it rank?",
      explanation: "Raise! AQo is a Tier 2 hand. It's strong enough to open from any position and can handle 3-bets reasonably well."
    },
    {
      question: "Finally, you pick up 22. The table is aggressive with lots of 3-betting. Raise, limp, or fold?",
      answer: "fold",
      hint: "With 22 from UTG at an aggressive table, what happens when you get 3-bet?",
      explanation: "Fold. While 22 can be opened at passive tables, facing frequent 3-bets with a hand that has no postflop playability is -EV. You're set-mining without the odds."
    }
