## Introduction

Want to see how winning players think in real-time? Video content lets you ride along with professionals as they make decisions, explain their reasoning, and navigate complex spots.

But there's a catch: most people watch poker videos wrong.

<KeyConcept title="The Video Study Paradox">
**Watching more videos doesn't mean learning more.**

Passive watching = entertainment
Active studying = improvement

The player who deeply studies 10 videos will improve more than one who casually watches 100. Quality of engagement matters far more than quantity.
</KeyConcept>

This module teaches you how to select the right content and study it effectively.

## Why Video Study Works

### Benefits of Video Content

**1. See Expert Thinking**
- Not just WHAT they do, but WHY
- Real-time reasoning process
- Learn their mental frameworks

**2. Context-Rich Learning**
- Concepts demonstrated in action
- See how theory applies to practice
- Memorable through storytelling

**3. Accessible and Engaging**
- More engaging than reading for many
- Learn during commute, workout, etc.
- Variety of formats and teachers

**4. World-Class Instruction**
- Access to top players' strategies
- Learn from people who've mastered the game
- Economical compared to private coaching

<Exercise
  question="What's the main advantage of video study over just reading poker strategy?"
  type="text"
  answer="You see concepts applied in real hands with explained reasoning"
  acceptableAnswers={["see it applied", "real hands", "context", "demonstration", "real-time thinking"]}
  hint="Think about what video adds that text can't."
  explanation="Video shows concepts in ACTION. You see the hand, hear the reasoning, understand the context. This is harder to convey in text. The combination of visual + audio + explanation creates stronger memory encoding."
/>

## Types of Poker Video Content

<FlashCards
  title="Video Content Types"
  cards={[
    { front: "Strategy/Concept Videos", back: "Focused teaching on specific topics (ranges, bet sizing, 3-betting). Best for learning new concepts systematically." },
    { front: "Play and Explain", back: "Coach plays live while explaining decisions. Best for seeing how to think in real-time and apply concepts." },
    { front: "Hand History Review", back: "Deep analysis of specific hands. Best for learning analysis techniques and seeing detailed breakdowns." },
    { front: "Theory Deep-Dives", back: "GTO, math, solver work, advanced concepts. Best for intermediate+ players wanting to understand WHY." },
    { front: "Live Streams", back: "Real-time play with commentary, often interactive. Best for entertainment + learning, Q&A opportunities." },
    { front: "Course Series", back: "Structured multi-video curriculum building on each lesson. Best for systematic improvement of specific area." }
  ]}
/>

### Matching Content to Goals

**Want to learn a new concept?** → Strategy/Concept videos
**Want to see concepts in action?** → Play and Explain
**Want to improve your analysis?** → Hand History Review
**Want to understand theory?** → Theory Deep-Dives
**Want entertainment + learning?** → Live Streams
**Want structured improvement?** → Course Series

<Exercise
  question="You're struggling with 3-betting. What type of video content should you prioritize?"
  type="choice"
  options={["Live streams - lots of 3-bet spots", "Strategy video on 3-betting - focused learning", "Any video - all content helps"]}
  answer="Strategy video on 3-betting - focused learning"
  explanation="A dedicated strategy video on 3-betting will cover the concept systematically - ranges, sizing, position, opponent adjustments. Live streams might have 3-bet spots, but they won't be organized or comprehensive. Target your weakness directly."
/>

## Content Selection

<KeyConcept title="Match Content to Your Level">
**Beginner watching advanced GTO = wasted time.**

The content must be:
1. Appropriate for your current skill level
2. Relevant to your game type (cash vs tournament)
3. Focused on your actual leaks
4. From credible sources

Watching content above your level feels productive but rarely is.
</KeyConcept>

### Level-Appropriate Content

**Beginner (first year):**
- Fundamentals: position, starting hands, pot odds
- Basic postflop concepts
- Play-and-explain at micro stakes
- Avoid: GTO solvers, advanced theory

**Intermediate (1-3 years):**
- Range construction and analysis
- Board texture and hand reading
- Opponent profiling and exploitation
- Introduction to solver concepts

**Advanced (3+ years):**
- GTO theory and solver work
- Thin value and balanced bluffing
- High-stakes play analysis
- Format-specific advanced strategy

<Exercise
  question="You've been playing for 6 months. A new 'Advanced GTO Solver Analysis' series is released. Should you watch it?"
  type="choice"
  options={["Yes - might as well learn the best strategy", "No - focus on fundamentals first", "Maybe - depends on the specific content"]}
  answer="No - focus on fundamentals first"
  explanation="At 6 months, you need fundamentals, not solver theory. GTO concepts require a strong foundation to understand and apply. You'll get much more value from beginner-appropriate content that addresses your actual leaks. Return to advanced content later."
/>

### Red Flags in Content Selection

**Avoid content that:**
- Comes from unknown/unproven players
- Is significantly outdated (5+ years old strategies)
- Doesn't match your format (MTT content for cash player)
- Promises quick fixes or secrets
- Focuses on results over process

## Evaluating Content Quality

<Comparison
  title="Content Quality Indicators"
  leftHeader="Good Signs"
  rightHeader="Warning Signs"
  leftItems={[
    "Coach has verifiable winning results",
    "Explains the WHY behind decisions",
    "Content is recent (within 2-3 years)",
    "Recommended by community/peers",
    "Admits when spots are close/unclear"
  ]}
  rightItems={[
    "Unknown player with no track record",
    "'Just do this' without reasoning",
    "Outdated (pre-solver era for advanced)",
    "Self-promoted with no reviews",
    "Claims to have all the answers"
  ]}
/>

### Questions to Ask

Before investing hours in a video series:

1. **Who is the coach?** What stakes do they beat? What's their background?
2. **When was it made?** Is the strategy still relevant?
3. **What level is it for?** Am I in the target audience?
4. **What do reviews say?** Is the community positive?
5. **Does the style work for me?** Some coaches connect better than others.

<Exercise
  question="You find a free YouTube series from 2015 by a well-known pro. The content seems solid. Should you study it?"
  type="text"
  answer="Use caution - fundamentals may be fine, but strategy has evolved significantly"
  acceptableAnswers={["be cautious", "maybe fundamentals only", "strategy outdated", "depends on content", "basics only"]}
  hint="Think about how poker strategy has changed since 2015."
  explanation="2015 is pre-solver era for most players. Basic fundamentals (position, pot odds) are timeless, but specific strategies (sizing, frequencies) have evolved significantly. Use old content for foundations, but verify strategic advice against modern resources."
/>

## Active vs Passive Watching

<Comparison
  title="How You Watch Matters More Than What You Watch"
  leftHeader="Passive Watching (Entertainment)"
  rightHeader="Active Studying (Improvement)"
  leftItems={[
    "Watch while eating or multitasking",
    "Let video play through without pausing",
    "No notes - rely on memory",
    "Forget most content within days",
    "Watch many videos superficially"
  ]}
  rightItems={[
    "Full attention, dedicated time",
    "Pause frequently to think",
    "Take detailed notes",
    "Review notes and implement lessons",
    "Master one video before moving on"
  ]}
/>

### The Brutal Truth

**Passive watching feels productive but isn't.**

You'll nod along, think "that makes sense," then forget 90% within a week. The only way to actually learn is to engage actively.

<Exercise
  question="You watched 3 hours of training videos this week while doing other things. How much did you likely retain?"
  type="choice"
  options={["Most of it - you were listening", "About half - some stuck", "Very little - passive watching doesn't work"]}
  answer="Very little - passive watching doesn't work"
  explanation="Research shows passive learning has very low retention rates. Without active engagement (pausing, thinking, noting), most content goes in one ear and out the other. Those 3 hours would be better spent on 1 hour of focused study."
/>

## Active Study Methods

<KeyConcept title="The Active Video Study Framework">
**Before watching:**
- Set a learning objective ("I want to understand X")
- Eliminate distractions
- Prepare note-taking materials

**During watching:**
- Pause frequently
- Predict decisions before coach reveals
- Take notes on key concepts
- Note timestamps for important moments

**After watching:**
- Summarize main points
- Create action items
- Schedule implementation
</KeyConcept>

### The Pause-and-Predict Technique

This is the highest-value study method:

1. **Coach shows a spot** (before revealing their action)
2. **Pause the video**
3. **Decide what YOU would do** and why
4. **Resume and compare** to coach's decision
5. **Analyze the gap** in your thinking

When your choice differs from the coach's, that's where learning happens.

<Exercise
  question="You pause a video before the coach acts. You think 'bet 75%' but the coach bets 33%. What should you do next?"
  type="text"
  answer="Listen carefully to WHY they chose 33%, note the reasoning, understand the gap"
  acceptableAnswers={["understand why", "listen to reasoning", "learn the difference", "note the gap", "figure out why"]}
  hint="The gap between your choice and theirs is the learning opportunity."
  explanation="This is exactly where learning happens. The coach chose differently - now understand WHY. Was your logic flawed? Did you miss something about the board or opponent? Write down the reasoning so you can apply it next time."
/>

### Effective Note-Taking

**What to capture:**
- Key concept in your own words
- Timestamp for important moments
- Specific examples given
- Questions you have
- How it applies to your game

**Note format example:**
```
[12:34] 3-betting from SB
- Coach 3-bets wider than I do from SB
- Reason: Position disadvantage means need more aggression
- His SB 3-bet range: 8-10% vs BTN opens
- Action item: Widen my SB 3-betting range
```

<Exercise
  question="Why should you write notes in your own words instead of copying exactly what the coach says?"
  type="text"
  answer="It forces you to process and understand the concept, not just transcribe"
  acceptableAnswers={["process the info", "understand it", "active learning", "forces thinking", "better retention"]}
  hint="What's the difference between copying and paraphrasing?"
  explanation="Paraphrasing requires understanding. When you translate the coach's words into your own language, you must process the concept first. Copying is passive - you can transcribe without understanding. Your own words = verified comprehension."
/>

## Applying Video Lessons

### The One-Concept Rule

**Don't try to change everything at once.**

After each video session:
1. Pick ONE concept to implement
2. Focus on that concept in your next sessions
3. Practice until it's automatic
4. Then add another concept

Trying to implement five new things = implementing zero things well.

<Exercise
  question="After watching a video, you have 5 new action items. What should you do?"
  type="choice"
  options={["Implement all 5 immediately", "Pick the most important 1-2 to focus on", "Rewatch the video to add more"]}
  answer="Pick the most important 1-2 to focus on"
  explanation="Cognitive overload prevents learning. Pick your biggest leak or most impactful concept and focus there. Write down the other 4 for later. Master one thing, then move to the next. This is slower but actually works."
/>

### Implementation Tracking

Keep a log:

| Concept | Video Source | Implemented | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Widen SB 3-bet range | ABC Poker Ep 12 | 1/15 | Practicing |
| Check-raise more turns | XYZ Course Pt 3 | 1/10 | Automatic now |
| Value bet rivers thinner | Stream highlight | Pending | Not started |

## Building a Video Study Curriculum

### Step 1: Identify Your Leaks

Before watching anything:
- Review your stats (VPIP, PFR, 3-bet, etc.)
- Do a hand history review
- List your biggest weaknesses

### Step 2: Find Targeted Content

Search for content addressing those specific leaks:
- "3-betting strategy for cash games"
- "River value betting"
- "Defending blinds"

### Step 3: Create a Structured Playlist

**Example 4-week curriculum:**

**Week 1:** Preflop fundamentals
- Opening ranges video
- 3-betting strategy
- Blind defense

**Week 2:** Flop play
- C-betting strategy
- Check-raising
- Playing draws

**Week 3:** Turn and river
- Barreling strategy
- River value betting
- River bluffing

**Week 4:** Advanced concepts
- Range analysis
- Hand reading
- Player profiling

### Step 4: Schedule Study Time

- 2-3 hours per week of active study
- Consistent schedule (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday 7pm)
- Dedicated environment (no distractions)
- Review notes before next session

<Exercise
  question="You have 5 hours per week for study. How should you split time between watching new content vs reviewing old notes/implementing?"
  type="choice"
  options={["5 hours new content - maximize learning", "2-3 hours new, 2-3 hours review/implementation", "1 hour new, 4 hours implementation"]}
  answer="2-3 hours new, 2-3 hours review/implementation"
  explanation="Balance is key. Watching without implementing = wasted time. Implementing without new input = slow progress. Roughly 50/50 split between new learning and consolidation/application gives best results."

## Practice: Evaluate Video Options

<MultiExercise
  title="Content Selection Practice"
  description="Decide which video content is appropriate for these situations."
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "Player A: 6 months experience, playing NL10, struggling with postflop play. They find a 'Solving OOP River Spots with PioSolver' video. Good choice?",
      answer: "No - too advanced, need basic postflop fundamentals first",
      explanation: "A 6-month player at NL10 needs basic postflop concepts (c-betting, hand reading basics), not solver analysis. This content is 2-3 years away from being useful. Find beginner postflop content instead."
    },
    {
      question: "Player B: 3 years experience, beating NL50, wants to improve 3-betting. They find a recent strategy video from a known NL200 regular on '3-bet pots for cash games.' Good choice?",
      answer: "Yes - appropriate level, relevant format, credible source, recent",
      explanation: "Great match. The player has enough experience to understand intermediate concepts. The content is from a proven winner, recent, and matches their format. This should provide actionable value."
    },
    {
      question: "Player C: Looking for content but only has time during their commute. What type of content should they seek?",
      answer: "Podcasts or audio-focused strategy discussions (not play-and-explain that requires visuals)",
      explanation: "Play-and-explain videos require seeing the screen. For audio-only time, seek podcasts, theory discussions, or strategy talks that don't depend on visuals. Save screen-dependent content for focused study sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "You found two videos on the same topic: one 45-minute deep-dive from a top coach, one 10-minute summary from an unknown creator. Which should you choose?",
      answer: "The 45-minute deep-dive from the known coach",
      explanation: "Quality over brevity. The 45-minute video from a proven coach will provide complete understanding. The 10-minute summary might give you misconceptions or incomplete information. Invest time in credible sources."
    }
  ]}

## Scenario: Creating Your Video Study Plan

<Scenario
  title="Building a Personal Video Curriculum"
  description="Let's walk through creating a targeted study plan."
  setup="You've been playing NL25 for 6 months. Your stats show: VPIP 27%, PFR 18% (gap of 9%), 3-bet 5%, WTSD 32%. You have 4 hours per week for video study. Let's build your curriculum."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "Looking at your stats, what's the biggest leak indicated by VPIP 27% / PFR 18% (9% gap)?",
      answer: "Too passive preflop - calling too much instead of raising",
      hint: "What does a large VPIP-PFR gap mean?",
      explanation: "A 9% gap means you're calling a lot more than raising. You're seeing flops passively with hands you should either raise or fold. This creates postflop difficulties. Content target: preflop aggression and range construction."
    },
    {
      question: "Your 3-bet is 5%. Average is 7-9%. What content would address this?",
      answer: "3-betting strategy video - specifically when/why to 3-bet more",
      hint: "You're 3-betting less than optimal.",
      explanation: "5% 3-bet is too low for most games. You're missing value with strong hands and not creating enough fold equity. Find a video specifically on 3-betting ranges and reasons to 3-bet (value, bluff, isolation)."
    },
    {
      question: "With 4 hours per week, how would you structure your study? (New content vs review/implementation)",
      answer: "2 hours new video study, 2 hours review notes and practice implementation",
      hint: "Remember the balance between learning and applying.",
      explanation: "2 hours watching new content actively (pausing, noting). 2 hours reviewing notes, applying concepts at the table, and hand review to see if you're implementing correctly. This balance ensures you actually improve, not just watch."
    },
    {
      question: "Create a 2-week content plan targeting your preflop aggression leak.",
      answer: "Week 1: Opening ranges and raising vs calling. Week 2: 3-betting strategy and blind defense",
      hint: "Start with fundamentals, then specific problem areas.",
      explanation: "Week 1 addresses the root issue (when to raise vs call preflop). Week 2 tackles the 3-betting leak specifically plus blind play (a common calling spot). After 2 weeks, reassess stats and adjust."
    }
  ]}
/>
