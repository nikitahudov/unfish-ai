## Introduction

You've learned which hands are playable (Module 2.1) and how position affects hand selection (Module 2.2). Now it's time to build your **open-raising ranges**—the specific hands you'll raise when the action folds to you.

Open raising (also called "RFI" or Raise First In) is the most common preflop action. You'll face this decision every orbit, often multiple times. Having a clear, well-constructed plan removes guesswork and prevents costly mistakes.

<KeyConcept title="What is RFI?">
**RFI (Raise First In)** means entering the pot with a raise when everyone before you has folded.

You're the first to put money in voluntarily. Your choices are:
- **Raise** — The standard play with playable hands
- **Limp** — Call the big blind without raising (usually bad)
- **Fold** — The correct play with weak hands
</KeyConcept>

This module gives you position-specific ranges to memorize and explains the reasoning behind them. By the end, you'll know exactly which hands to raise from each seat.

---

## Why Raise Instead of Limp?

Before diving into ranges, let's address the elephant in the room: why not just limp with speculative hands?

<KeyConcept title="Why Limping Is Usually Wrong">
Limping (just calling the big blind) is inferior to raising for several reasons:

1. **No fold equity** — You can't win the pot preflop
2. **No range definition** — Opponents can have anything
3. **Invite multiway pots** — Others pile in cheaply
4. **Lose initiative** — Someone else takes control
</KeyConcept>

### The Raise Advantage

When you raise, you:
- **Win immediately** when everyone folds
- **Define opponent's range** (they call or 3-bet with specific hands)
- **Build the pot** with your good hands
- **Take initiative** (you're the "aggressor")

<Exercise
  question="What is the main disadvantage of limping instead of raising?"
  type="text"
  answer="no fold equity"
  acceptableAnswers={["no fold equity", "No fold equity", "fold equity", "can't win preflop", "everyone can call cheaply"]}
  hint="What can't you accomplish by just calling?"
  explanation="No fold equity is the biggest issue. When you raise, everyone might fold and you win immediately. When you limp, you're guaranteed to see a flop—and guaranteed to put more money in without knowing your opponents' hands."
/>

### When Limping CAN Be Okay

There are rare exceptions, primarily in specific live games:
- **Loose-passive live games** where raises don't thin the field
- **Behind multiple limpers** with speculative hands (over-limping)
- **Specific exploitative spots** against very particular opponents

But as a default: **raise or fold**.

---

## Standard Open Raise Sizing

Before we get to ranges, let's establish sizing:

<KeyConcept variant="formula" title="Standard Open Raise Sizing">
**Online 6-max:** 2.5 big blinds (sometimes 2.2-2.5bb)

**Live poker:** 3 big blinds (sometimes 4bb due to looser calls)

**Adjustments:**
- Add 1bb per limper if anyone limped
- You can size up from early position (3bb) if preferred
- Size down if stacks are short (20bb or less)
</KeyConcept>

### Keep Sizing Consistent

Don't raise 2.5bb with speculative hands and 4bb with AA. Observant opponents will exploit you. Use the same size with your entire range from each position.

<Exercise
  question="In a live game, two players limp. What should your raise size be with a hand you'd normally open for 3bb?"
  type="text"
  answer="5bb"
  acceptableAnswers={["5bb", "5 bb", "5", "5 big blinds"]}
  hint="Standard is 3bb + 1bb per limper"
  explanation="5bb. Your standard 3bb + 1bb for each limper (2 limpers = 2bb extra) = 5bb. This helps thin the field—you don't want 4 people seeing a flop."
/>

---

## Position-Based RFI Ranges

Now for the meat of the module: your open-raising ranges by position. These are for **6-max** games, which are most common online. Adjust slightly tighter for 9-max.

<FlashCards
  title="RFI Ranges by Position (6-Max)"
  cards={[
    { front: "UTG (~12-15%)", back: "AA-77, AKs-ATs, KQs-KJs, QJs, AKo-AJo, KQo" },
    { front: "MP (~16-20%)", back: "UTG range + 66, A9s, KTs, QTs, JTs, ATo" },
    { front: "HJ (~20-25%)", back: "MP range + 55, A8s-A5s, K9s, Q9s, J9s, T9s, 98s, KJo, QJo" },
    { front: "CO (~27-32%)", back: "HJ range + 44-22, A4s-A2s, K8s-K6s, Q8s, J8s, T8s, 97s, 87s, 76s, KTo, QTo, JTo" },
    { front: "BTN (~40-50%)", back: "CO range + K5s-K2s, Q7s-Q5s, J7s, T7s, 96s, 86s, 75s, 65s, 54s, K9o, Q9o, J9o, T9o" },
    { front: "SB (~35-45%)", back: "Similar to BTN range, sometimes tighter. Some players limp SB in certain games." }
  ]}
/>

### Understanding the Percentages

A 15% range means you open 15% of all possible hands. Here's what that feels like:
- **10%** = Ultra-tight: Only premiums
- **15%** = Tight: Premiums + strong hands
- **25%** = Standard: Adding some speculative hands
- **35%** = Wide: Most playable hands included
- **50%** = Very wide: Nearly half of all hands

<Exercise
  question="What approximate percentage of hands should you open from the CO in 6-max?"
  type="number"
  answer={30}
  acceptableRange={[27, 32]}
  unit="%"
  hint="CO is late position with only BTN and blinds behind..."
  explanation="About 27-32%. The CO is a profitable stealing position with only 3 players behind, allowing you to play a much wider range than early positions."
/>

## Visualizing Ranges on the Matrix

Let's see what these ranges look like on the hand matrix. Here's a typical **UTG** range:

```
    A   K   Q   J   T   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2
A  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
K  [A] [A] [A] [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
Q  [A] [A] [A] [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
J   -  [A] [A] [A] [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
T   -   -   -  [A] [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
9   -   -   -   -   -  [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -   -
8   -   -   -   -   -   -  [A]  -   -   -   -   -   -
7   -   -   -   -   -   -   -  [A]  -   -   -   -   -
6   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
5   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
4   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
3   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
2   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -

[A] = Always raise
```

Compare to a typical **Button** range—notice how much more of the matrix is filled:

```
    A   K   Q   J   T   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2
A  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]
K  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   ~   ~
Q  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   ~   -   -   -
J  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -   -   -   -   -
T  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -   -   -   -   -
9   ~  [A] [A] [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -   -   -   -   -
8   ~   ~   ~   ~  [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -   -   -   -
7   ~   ~   ~   ~   ~  [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -   -   -
6   ~   -   -   -   -   ~  [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -   -
5   ~   -   -   -   -   -   ~  [A] [A] [A] [A]  ~   -
4   ~   -   -   -   -   -   -   ~   ~  [A] [A]  -   -
3   ~   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   ~  [A] [A]  -
2   ~   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -  [A] [A]

[A] = Always raise    ~ = Sometimes (mixed)    - = Fold
```

<Exercise
  question="Looking at range charts, which hands get added from UTG to the Button first: suited connectors or small pairs?"
  type="text"
  answer="both around the same time"
  acceptableAnswers={["both", "Both", "both around the same time", "similar", "Similar", "depends"]}
  hint="Think about when HJ/CO ranges expand..."
  explanation="They're added around the same time (HJ-CO). Small pairs get added slightly earlier for set-mining value, but suited connectors join the range by the cutoff. Both are speculative hands that need the positional advantage of late position."
/>

## Dynamic Adjustments

Your baseline ranges are a starting point. Good players adjust based on table conditions:

<Comparison
  title="When to Widen vs. Tighten Ranges"
  left={{
    title: "Widen Your Range When",
    items: [
      "Table is tight/passive",
      "Blinds defend rarely",
      "No aggressive 3-bettors behind",
      "You have image as tight player",
      "Deep stacks (more implied odds)"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "Tighten Your Range When",
    items: [
      "Table is loose/aggressive",
      "Players 3-bet frequently",
      "You've been caught bluffing",
      "Short stacks behind (shove risk)",
      "You're running bad (tilt prevention)"
    ]
  }}
/>

### Adjusting for Specific Opponents

- **Tight player in BB?** Steal wider; they'll fold too much.
- **Maniac on your left?** Tighten up; expect 3-bets.
- **Calling station behind?** Raise for value; skip bluff hands.

<Exercise
  question="The player in the big blind folds 80% to steals. Should you open wider or tighter from the button?"
  type="text"
  answer="wider"
  acceptableAnswers={["wider", "Wider", "WIDER"]}
  hint="If they fold a lot, what does that mean for your marginal hands?"
  explanation="Much wider! If the BB folds 80% of the time, you're printing money by opening any two cards. Your marginal hands become profitable because you win without a fight most of the time."
/>

<Exercise
  question="The player to your left 3-bets you 25% of the time (very aggressive). How should you adjust your opening range?"
  type="text"
  answer="tighter"
  acceptableAnswers={["tighter", "Tighter", "TIGHTER"]}
  hint="If you open and face a 3-bet often, what hands can handle that?"
  explanation="Tighten up. With an aggressive 3-bettor behind you, many hands become unprofitable to open because you'll face a 3-bet and be forced to fold (or call/4-bet poorly). Stick to hands that can handle aggression."
/>

## Range Balance Introduction

At higher stakes, opponents study your ranges. If your UTG range is only AA-JJ and AK, observant players will exploit you.

<KeyConcept title="What Is Range Balance?">
A **balanced** range contains a mix of:
- **Value hands** — Hands that want action (AA, AK)
- **Bluff/semi-bluff hands** — Hands with equity that balance out the value (A5s, suited connectors)

Balance makes you harder to play against because opponents can't narrow your range easily.
</KeyConcept>

### Why A5s Makes Your Range Better

You might wonder: "Why open A5s from the cutoff? It's not that strong."

Here's why:
1. **Blocks AA and 55** — Opponents have fewer premium holdings
2. **Makes nut flushes** — When you hit, it's the nuts
3. **Can make straights** — A-2-3-4-5 is possible
4. **Balances your range** — Now "suited ace" on a flush board could be A5s or AKs

<Exercise
  question="Why is having some 'weaker' hands like suited connectors in your raising range actually good?"
  type="text"
  answer="balance"
  acceptableAnswers={["balance", "Balance", "balances range", "makes range balanced", "harder to read"]}
  hint="Think about what your range looks like to opponents..."
  explanation="Balance! If you only raise premiums, opponents can easily put you on a narrow range and exploit you. Adding playable speculative hands makes your range wider and harder to play against."
/>

### Balance Matters More Against Good Players

Against beginners who don't think about ranges, balance is less important—they're not exploiting you anyway. Against thinking players, having a balanced range prevents exploitation.

## RFI Decision Framework

When the action folds to you, run through this mental checklist:

<KeyConcept title="RFI Checklist">
1. **What position am I in?** → Determines base range
2. **What's my hand?** → Is it in my range for this position?
3. **Who's behind me?** → Any 3-bettors or calling stations?
4. **Stack sizes?** → Very short stacks change dynamics
5. **What sizing?** → Standard or adjusted for conditions
</KeyConcept>

### Example: J♦T♦ from the Hijack

1. **Position:** Hijack (20-25% range)
2. **Hand:** JTs is in the HJ range ✓
3. **Behind:** Standard players
4. **Stacks:** All 100bb
5. **Sizing:** 2.5bb (standard)

**Decision:** Raise to 2.5bb.

### Example: K♥9♥ from UTG

1. **Position:** UTG (12-15% range)
2. **Hand:** K9s is NOT in UTG range ✗
3. **Behind:** Doesn't matter—hand too weak
4. **Stacks:** Doesn't matter—hand too weak
5. **Sizing:** Doesn't matter—folding

**Decision:** Fold.

## Practice: Build Your Range

<MultiExercise
  title="RFI Practice Problems"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "UTG in 6-max with A♠J♦ (AJo). Raise or fold?",
      answer: "Raise",
      explanation: "Raise. AJo is in most UTG ranges—it's a strong broadway hand. Open to 2.5-3bb."
    },
    {
      question: "UTG with 8♠7♠. Raise or fold?",
      answer: "Fold",
      explanation: "Fold. 87s is too speculative for UTG. You'll face overcards often and have bad relative position postflop."
    },
    {
      question: "Button with K♦7♦. Raise or fold?",
      answer: "Raise",
      explanation: "Raise. K7s is in most button ranges. You have position, steal equity, and decent playability."
    },
    {
      question: "Cutoff with 5♣5♦. Raise or fold?",
      answer: "Raise",
      explanation: "Raise. Small pairs are opens from the CO. Set-mining potential plus position makes this profitable."
    },
    {
      question: "MP with Q♥J♣ (QJo). Raise or fold?",
      answer: "Fold (or sometimes raise)",
      explanation: "This is borderline. Many players fold QJo from MP due to domination concerns. Some include it. If you play it, be ready to fold to 3-bets."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Scenario: RFI Decision Making

<Scenario
  title="A Complete Orbit"
  setup="You're playing 6-max online with 100bb stacks. Let's work through an entire orbit of RFI decisions. The action folds to you each time."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "You're UTG with A♥K♥. What do you do?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "AKs is as premium as it gets for non-pairs...",
      explanation: "Raise to 2.5bb. AKs is a premium hand that opens from any position. You're hoping to get 3-bet so you can 4-bet or call."
    },
    {
      question: "You're in MP with 9♠8♠. What do you do?",
      answer: "fold",
      hint: "98s is a nice hand, but consider your position...",
      explanation: "Fold. 98s is too speculative for MP. Save this hand for later positions where you have more fold equity and better position postflop."
    },
    {
      question: "You're in the Hijack with A♦4♦. What do you do?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "A4s in late position with suited ace potential...",
      explanation: "Raise to 2.5bb. A4s is in most HJ ranges. You have nut flush potential, can make the wheel straight, and have decent steal equity."
    },
    {
      question: "You're on the Button with J♣8♣. What do you do?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "The button is the widest opening position...",
      explanation: "Raise to 2.5bb. J8s is well within button opening range. You have great position, fold equity against the blinds, and playable postflop equity when called."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using the Same Range from Every Position

UTG and button require completely different ranges. Playing 30% from UTG or 15% from the button both cost money.

### Mistake 2: Sizing Tells

Raising 2bb with speculative hands and 3bb with premiums is a massive leak. Good opponents will notice and 3-bet your small raises while folding to large ones.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Table Dynamics

Your baseline ranges assume "average" opponents. Real tables require adjustment. Don't autopilot.

### Mistake 4: Limping "Because the Hand Is Too Weak to Raise"

If it's too weak to raise, it's too weak to play. Limping gives up all initiative for a small savings.

### Mistake 5: Not Knowing Your Ranges

"I think 76s is in my CO range... maybe?" This uncertainty costs chips. Study and memorize your ranges until they're automatic.

<Exercise
  question="You notice you're raising 3bb with AK and 2.5bb with suited connectors. What's the problem?"
  type="text"
  answer="sizing tell"
  acceptableAnswers={["sizing tell", "Sizing tell", "tells", "opponents can read you", "predictable", "exploitable"]}
  hint="Think about what information you're giving away..."
  explanation="You have a sizing tell! Opponents who pay attention will 3-bet your small raises (knowing you're weaker) and fold to your large raises (knowing you're strong). Use consistent sizing."
/>

---

## Summary

<KeyConcept title="Key Takeaways">
1. **Raise or fold** — Limping is usually wrong
2. **Position dictates range** — 15% from UTG, 45% from BTN
3. **Use consistent sizing** — 2.5bb standard, avoid tells
4. **Adjust for table dynamics** — Widen vs tight, tighten vs aggressive
5. **Balance your range** — Include some speculative hands
6. **Memorize your ranges** — Uncertainty costs chips
</KeyConcept>

You now have a solid foundation for preflop play. You know which hands to play (Module 2.1), where position matters (Module 2.2), and exactly which hands to open-raise from each position (this module). These skills alone will make you profitable at low stakes.
