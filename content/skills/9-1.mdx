## Introduction

You just finished a session. You won some big pots, lost some big pots. But what did you actually *learn*?

Most players treat poker sessions like individual events—win or lose, then move on. Winning players treat every session as data. They review their hands, identify mistakes, and continuously improve.

<KeyConcept title="The Most Effective Form of Study">
**Hand history review is the highest-ROI poker study you can do.**

Why? Because you're studying YOUR game:
- Your specific leaks (not generic concepts)
- Your actual opponents (not theoretical villains)
- Your real decisions (not hypotheticals)
- Your emotional patterns (tilt, fear, overconfidence)

One hour of focused hand review often beats five hours of video watching.
</KeyConcept>

This module teaches you how to select, analyze, and learn from your hands systematically.

## Why Review Hands?

### Benefits of Regular Review

**1. Find Hidden Leaks**
- Mistakes you don't notice in real-time
- Patterns across many hands
- "I call too much on rivers" only visible with data

**2. Reinforce Good Decisions**
- Identify what you're doing RIGHT
- Build confidence in your game
- Don't just focus on negatives

**3. Build Pattern Recognition**
- Similar spots appear repeatedly
- Review speeds up decision-making
- "I've seen this before" moments

**4. Emotional Distance**
- In-game: emotional, time pressure
- Review: calm, objective analysis
- See the hand clearly without stress

<Exercise
  question="Why is hand review often more valuable than watching training videos?"
  type="text"
  answer="It's specific to YOUR game, your leaks, your opponents - not generic concepts"
  acceptableAnswers={["specific to my game", "my leaks", "my mistakes", "personal", "your own hands"]}
  hint="Think about relevance to your specific game."
  explanation="Training videos teach general concepts, but hand review addresses YOUR specific patterns, YOUR opponents, and YOUR decisions. It's personalized study that directly targets your weaknesses."

## Hand Selection for Review

<KeyConcept title="Which Hands to Review">
**The biggest mistake: Only reviewing big pots you lost.**

Big pot ≠ important learning opportunity.

Instead, review:
- **Uncertain decisions:** Spots where you weren't sure what to do
- **Close calls:** Could have gone either way
- **Won but played poorly:** Got lucky despite bad play
- **Lost but played well:** Good decision, bad result
- **Recurring situations:** Spots you face often
</KeyConcept>

### The Results-Independent Selection Process

**Step 1:** Tag hands during play (most software allows this)
- "Interesting"
- "Unsure"
- "Review later"

**Step 2:** After the session, select 5-10 hands
- Mix of wins and losses
- Focus on decision quality, not outcome

**Step 3:** Prioritize hands where you felt uncertain or uncomfortable

<Exercise
  question="You lost a big pot when your AA got cracked by 72o all-in preflop. You also won a medium pot where you weren't sure if your river bet was a good idea. Which hand should you prioritize for review?"
  type="choice"
  options={["The AA hand - it was a bigger pot", "The river bet hand - there's more to learn", "Both equally - all hands matter"]}
  answer="The river bet hand - there's more to learn"
  explanation="The AA vs 72o hand has nothing to learn - you played it correctly, villain made a bad call that happened to get there. The river bet hand has actual uncertainty to analyze. Pot size doesn't equal learning value."
/>

### Hands NOT Worth Reviewing

- Standard plays that went as expected
- Coolers (KK vs AA all-in preflop)
- Obvious bad beats with no decision point
- Hands where opponent made massive mistake

<Exercise
  question="Which of these hands has the MOST learning value? A) You fold 72o preflop, B) Your set loses to a backdoor flush, C) You're unsure if your turn check-raise was correct"
  type="choice"
  options={["A - Disciplined fold", "B - Understanding bad beats", "C - Analyzing uncertain decision"]}
  answer="C - Analyzing uncertain decision"
  explanation="Option A is autopilot (no decision to analyze). Option B is a cooler (no mistake made). Option C has real uncertainty - you can analyze if the check-raise was correct and learn for future similar spots."
/>

## The Hand Review Framework

### Step-by-Step Analysis Process

**Step 1: Recreate the Situation**
- What did you KNOW at the time?
- Stack sizes, positions, opponent reads
- Don't use hindsight information

**Step 2: List Your Options**
- What actions were available?
- Fold, check, call, bet/raise (and different sizes)
- Don't limit yourself to just two options

**Step 3: Evaluate Each Option**
- Pros and cons of each action
- Expected results against opponent's range
- Risk vs reward

**Step 4: Compare to What You Did**
- What did you actually choose?
- Was it the best option? Why or why not?

**Step 5: Identify the Lesson**
- What's the takeaway?
- How does this apply to future hands?
- Create an action item

/>

---

## Avoiding Results-Oriented Thinking

<KeyConcept title="The Cardinal Sin of Hand Review">
**Results-oriented thinking:** Evaluating decisions based on outcomes instead of process.

- "I called and won, so it was a good call" (WRONG)
- "I called and lost, so it was a bad call" (WRONG)
- "Given what I knew, calling was +EV" (RIGHT)

The quality of a decision is independent of the outcome.
</KeyConcept>

### Examples of Results-Oriented Thinking

**Bad Call That Won:**
- You call a river bet getting 2:1 with 10% equity
- You hit your miracle card
- "Good call!" - NO. Terrible call that got lucky.

**Good Call That Lost:**
- You call a river bet getting 2:1 with 40% equity
- You miss
- "Bad call, should have folded" - NO. Great call that didn't work out this time.

### The Correct Question

When reviewing any decision, ask:

**"Given the information I had at the time, would I make this same decision again?"**

If yes → Good decision (regardless of outcome)
If no → What would I do differently?

<Exercise
  question="You make a call on the river getting 3:1 odds with approximately 20% equity. You lose the hand. Was this a good or bad call?"
  type="choice"
  options={["Good call - pot odds were there", "Bad call - you lost", "Bad call - you needed 25% equity but only had 20%"]}
  answer="Bad call - you needed 25% equity but only had 20%"
  explanation="Getting 3:1 odds means you need 25% equity to break even (1/4 = 25%). With only 20% equity, this is a losing call long-term. The fact that you lost THIS time is irrelevant - the call was -EV regardless of outcome."
/>

## Common Mistakes to Look For

### Preflop Errors

- **Playing too wide:** Opening hands you shouldn't from certain positions
- **Playing too tight:** Missing profitable opportunities
- **Wrong sizing:** Opens too small (see more flops) or too big (narrow range)
- **Positional mistakes:** Calling raises out of position with weak hands
- **Ignoring stack depth:** Not adjusting for short or deep stacks

<Exercise
  question="Reviewing your database, you notice you're losing money with suited connectors from UTG but winning with them from the button. What's the likely leak?"
  type="text"
  answer="Playing suited connectors too wide from early position"
  acceptableAnswers={["too wide from UTG", "positional mistake", "playing too loose early position", "suited connectors from UTG"]}
  hint="What's different about UTG vs button?"
  explanation="Suited connectors play much better in position with fewer players behind. From UTG, you face more players who can wake up with premium hands, and you'll often be out of position postflop. This is a classic positional leak."
/>

### Postflop Errors

**Flop:**
- C-betting too frequently (auto-betting every flop)
- C-betting too rarely (giving up equity)
- Wrong sizing for board texture
- Missing value on strong hands

**Turn:**
- Giving up too easily after one call
- Overplaying medium-strength hands
- Not recognizing changing hand strength
- Pot control when you should be betting

**River:**
- Missing thin value bets
- Bluffing in bad spots
- Hero calling without good reason
- Sizing tells (small = value, big = bluff)

<Exercise
  question="You review 10 hands where you c-bet the flop, got called, then checked the turn and river. You won 2 of them at showdown. What's the likely issue?"
  type="text"
  answer="Giving up too easily after getting called (need to barrel more)"
  acceptableAnswers={["give up too easily", "not barreling", "need to bet more turns", "too passive after flop"]}
  hint="You're winning 20% at showdown after giving up."
  explanation="If you're only winning 20% at showdown, you're reaching showdown with weak hands. More importantly, you're probably missing value and giving opponents free cards. You need to continue betting for value on turns when appropriate."
/>

## Analysis Techniques

### Range Analysis

For every decision, ask: "What could opponent have?"

**Put opponent on a range, not a hand.**

Example process:
1. What hands would opponent play this way preflop?
2. How does the flop change that range?
3. What hands continue on the turn?
4. What's their river range?

### EV Estimation

Rough expected value calculation:

**EV = (Win% × Amount Won) - (Lose% × Amount Lost)**

Example: Calling $50 into $150 pot with 35% equity
- Win: 35% × $200 = $70
- Lose: 65% × $50 = $32.50
- EV = $70 - $32.50 = +$37.50

You don't need exact math—direction matters (is this + or -EV?).

<Exercise
  question="The pot is $100. Opponent bets $50. You think you have 30% equity. Is calling +EV or -EV?"
  type="choice"
  options={["+EV - you're getting good odds", "-EV - you don't have enough equity", "Breakeven - exactly 3:1"]}
  answer="+EV - you're getting good odds"
  explanation="You call $50 to win $150 (pot + bet). That's 3:1 odds, requiring 25% equity. With 30% equity, you're above the threshold - this is a +EV call. EV = (0.30 × $150) - (0.70 × $50) = $45 - $35 = +$10."
/>

### The "Pro Test"

Ask yourself: "What would a strong player do here?"

This forces you to:
- Consider what optimal play looks like
- Identify gaps in your game
- Think beyond your default action

## Extracting Lessons

### From Analysis to Action

**Bad lesson:** "I should have folded that hand."
**Good lesson:** "When facing river raises, I call too often without blockers."

**Bad lesson:** "That bluff didn't work."
**Good lesson:** "Bluffing into calling stations is -EV; I need to value bet them more."

### Creating Action Items

Every hand review should produce an action item:

- "Next session, I will fold more to river raises from tight players."
- "I will stop c-betting every flop with air on wet boards."
- "When I flop a set, I will slow down on paired boards."

<Exercise
  question="You review a hand where you bluffed into a known calling station and got snapped off. What's the best action item?"
  type="text"
  answer="Value bet calling stations more, bluff them less"
  acceptableAnswers={["value bet more", "bluff less against stations", "don't bluff calling stations", "adjust to player type"]}
  hint="How should you exploit a calling station?"
  explanation="Calling stations call too much - that's their defining trait. The correct adjustment is to bluff them less (they won't fold) and value bet them more (they'll call with worse). The lesson isn't 'don't bluff' - it's 'adjust bluff frequency to opponent type.'"
/>

### Building a Leak List

Track recurring patterns:

| Leak | Frequency | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Calling river raises too light | High | Working on it |
| C-betting 100% of flops | Medium | Fixed |
| Playing too wide from blinds | Low | Identified |

Review this list monthly. Celebrate fixed leaks!

## Review Tools and Methods

### Software Features

**PokerTracker 4 / HM3:**
- Hand replayer with action-by-action review
- Filter hands by result, position, action
- Tag hands during play for later review
- Export hands for sharing

### Sharing Hands for Feedback

**Forum posting format:**

```
Stakes: NL50
Hero: BTN ($52)
Villain: BB ($48) - TAG regular, 22/18 over 500 hands

Preflop: Hero dealt A♠K♦
folds to Hero, Hero raises $1.25, SB folds, BB calls

Flop ($2.75): J♥7♠4♣
BB checks, Hero bets $1.75, BB calls

Turn ($6.25): T♠
BB checks, Hero ???

My thoughts: [Your analysis]
Question: Should I continue betting or check back?
```

<Exercise
  question="Why is it important to include opponent reads and stats when posting hands for review?"
  type="text"
  answer="So reviewers can give advice specific to that opponent type"
  acceptableAnswers={["opponent specific advice", "context matters", "adjustments depend on opponent", "different advice for different players"]}
  hint="Would you play differently against a nit vs a maniac?"
  explanation="Without opponent info, reviewers can only give generic advice. A check might be correct vs a nit but wrong vs a calling station. Include reads so feedback is tailored to the actual situation."
/>

---

## Building the Review Habit

### Start Small

- **Week 1:** Review 3 hands after each session
- **Week 2:** Review 5 hands per session
- **Month 2:** Review 10 hands or 30 minutes

### Use a Template

**Hand Review Template:**

1. **Situation:** [Position, stacks, opponent type]
2. **Action:** [What happened]
3. **Options:** [What could I have done?]
4. **My choice:** [What I did and why]
5. **Analysis:** [Was it correct?]
6. **Lesson:** [What did I learn?]
7. **Action item:** [What will I do differently?]

### Schedule It

- Review immediately after session (while fresh)
- OR schedule dedicated review time (1-2 hours weekly)
- Don't skip—this is where improvement happens

<MultiExercise
  title="Hand Review Practice"
  description="Analyze this hand and identify the key issues."
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "Hand: You open KQo from MP, BB calls. Flop: A72r. You c-bet 50%, BB calls. Turn: 5. You bet 66%, BB calls. River: 3. You bet 75%, BB calls and shows A8. First question: What was your likely mistake?",
      answer: "Triple barreling for value with a bluff (you had no value to bet)",
      explanation: "You had K-high - a bluff. But you bet three streets like you had value. Once called on flop and turn, your bluff isn't working. The river bet is lighting money on fire."
    },
    {
      question: "When should you have stopped betting?",
      answer: "After the turn call at the latest (probably after the flop call)",
      explanation: "Once a BB defends flop and turn on A-high board, they almost always have an ace or strong draw. Your K-high has no equity when called. Give up on turn or river."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the generalizable lesson from this hand?",
      answer: "Don't keep barreling as a bluff when opponent shows strength by calling",
      explanation: "Bluffs need fold equity. Once an opponent calls flop and turn, your fold equity is minimal. Either pick better bluff spots (better blockers, better runouts) or give up earlier."
    },
    {
      question: "Create an action item from this analysis.",
      answer: "Check turn or river more often with air when opponent shows resistance",
      hint: "What will you do differently next time?",
      explanation: "Action item: 'When I c-bet as a bluff and get called, I will evaluate if continuing to bluff makes sense based on opponent's likely holdings and fold equity, rather than auto-barreling.'"
    }

## Scenario: Complete Hand Review Process

<Scenario
  title="Walking Through a Hand Review"
  description="Let's review a hand together using the complete framework."
  setup="You played NL50 last night. This hand felt weird and you tagged it for review. Hero (BTN, $52) with 9♠8♠. UTG ($48, unknown) opens to $1.25. Folds to Hero. Hero calls. Blinds fold. Heads-up to flop. Flop ($3.25): 7♠6♦2♣. UTG bets $2. Hero calls. Turn ($7.25): K♥. UTG bets $5. Hero folds."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "Step 1: Recreate - What did you know at the time of the turn decision?",
      answer: "Open-ended straight draw, out of position caller, UTG opener (likely strong range), pot is $7.25, facing $5 bet",
      hint: "Position, hand strength, opponent range, pot size",
      explanation: "You had an OESD (8 outs to straight). UTG's range is typically tight (premium pairs, AK, AQ). You called flop hoping to improve. Turn K is a brick for you but could hit villain's range."
    },
    {
      question: "Step 2: List options - What could you do facing the $5 turn bet?",
      answer: "Fold, call, or raise",
      hint: "Standard options when facing a bet",
      explanation: "Fold: Give up the draw. Call: Try to hit river for $5. Raise: Represent the K or semi-bluff. Each has merit depending on math and opponent."
    },
    {
      question: "Step 3: Evaluate - You're getting $12.25 : $5 (about 2.5:1). With 8 outs, is calling correct?",
      answer: "Close but slightly -EV (need ~15% equity, have ~16%, but face river bet if miss)",
      hint: "8 outs = roughly 16% to hit. Required equity for 2.5:1?",
      explanation: "8 outs gives ~16% to hit (8 × 2). Pot odds of 2.5:1 need ~29% equity. However, if you're drawing dead to some combos or facing a river bet when you miss, calling becomes thin. The fold is reasonable."
    },
    {
      question: "Step 4 & 5: Compare and Extract - You folded. Was this correct? What's the lesson?",
      answer: "Fold was reasonable but calling could also be defended. Lesson: Calculate pot odds in-game for draws",
      hint: "Was there a clear mistake?",
      explanation: "The fold was close but defensible - you didn't have implied odds and UTG's range is strong. Key lesson: Practice pot odds calculations so these decisions become automatic. Also consider raise as a semi-bluff (representing K) against certain opponents."
    }
