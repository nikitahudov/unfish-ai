## Introduction

Every poker decision comes down to one question: *Is this profitable in the long run?*

Pot odds are your answer. They tell you the **price** you're getting on a call and help you determine if that price is good enough based on your chances of winning.

Think of it like shopping. If someone offers to sell you a lottery ticket with a 25% chance of winning $100, how much would you pay? If the ticket costs $20, it's a good deal (expected value: $25). If it costs $30, it's a bad deal.

Pot odds work the same way in poker.

<KeyConcept title="The Core Principle">
**Call when your chance of winning exceeds the price you're paying.**

If you need to call $25 to win a $100 pot, you're getting 4:1 odds. You only need to win 20% of the time to break even.
</KeyConcept>

## What Are Pot Odds?

Pot odds express the relationship between the current pot and the cost of your call. They can be written two ways:

**As a Ratio:** 4:1 (read as "four to one")
- Means you win $4 for every $1 you risk

**As a Percentage:** 20%
- Means you need to win 20% of the time to break even

Both formats tell you the same thing - they're just different ways of expressing the "price" of your call.

### The Pot Odds Formula

<KeyConcept variant="formula" title="Pot Odds Formula">
**Ratio Format:**
Pot Odds = Total Pot : Your Call

**Percentage Format:**
Pot Odds % = Your Call ÷ (Total Pot + Your Call) × 100
</KeyConcept>

Let's break this down:

1. **Total Pot** = Everything in the pot INCLUDING your opponent's current bet
2. **Your Call** = The amount you need to put in to continue

### Example Calculation

The pot is $75. Your opponent bets $25. What are your pot odds?

**Step 1:** Calculate the total pot after the bet
- Total pot = $75 + $25 = $100

**Step 2:** Express as a ratio
- Pot odds = $100 : $25 = 4:1

**Step 3:** Convert to percentage (optional)
- $25 ÷ ($100 + $25) = $25 ÷ $125 = 0.20 = 20%

You're getting 4:1 odds, meaning you need to win just 20% of the time to break even.

<Exercise
  question="The pot is $60. Your opponent bets $20. What are your pot odds as a ratio?"
  type="text"
  answer="4:1"
  acceptableAnswers={["4:1", "4 to 1", "4-1", "4 : 1"]}
  hint="First add the bet to the pot, then express as Pot : Call"
  explanation="Total pot = $60 + $20 = $80. Pot odds = $80 : $20 = 4:1. You're getting 4-to-1 on your call."
/>

<Exercise
  question="The pot is $150. Your opponent bets $50. What percentage of the time do you need to win to break even?"
  type="number"
  answer={25}
  acceptableRange={[24, 26]}
  unit="%"
  hint="Use the formula: Call ÷ (Pot + Call) × 100"
  explanation="Total pot = $150 + $50 = $200. You call $50. Percentage = $50 ÷ ($200 + $50) = $50 ÷ $250 = 0.20 = 25%"
/>

## Converting Between Ratios and Percentages

Being able to quickly convert between formats is essential. Here's how:

### Ratio to Percentage

<KeyConcept variant="formula" title="Ratio → Percentage">
Percentage = 1 ÷ (Ratio + 1) × 100

**Example:** 3:1 odds
= 1 ÷ (3 + 1) × 100
= 1 ÷ 4 × 100
= 25%
</KeyConcept>

### Percentage to Ratio

<KeyConcept variant="formula" title="Percentage → Ratio">
Ratio = (100 - Percentage) : Percentage

**Example:** 25%
= (100 - 25) : 25
= 75 : 25
= 3:1
</KeyConcept>

<Exercise
  question="Convert 5:1 pot odds to a percentage."
  type="number"
  answer={16.7}
  acceptableRange={[16, 17]}
  unit="%"
  hint="Use: 1 ÷ (5 + 1) × 100"
  explanation="1 ÷ (5 + 1) = 1 ÷ 6 = 0.167 = 16.7%. With 5:1 odds, you need to win about 17% of the time."
/>

<Exercise
  question="Convert 2:1 pot odds to a percentage."
  type="number"
  answer={33}
  acceptableRange={[32, 34]}
  unit="%"
  hint="Use: 1 ÷ (2 + 1) × 100"
  explanation="1 ÷ (2 + 1) = 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333 = 33%. With 2:1 odds, you need to win about 33% of the time."
/>

## Common Bet Sizes and Their Pot Odds

Certain bet sizes come up constantly in poker. Memorizing these will let you calculate instantly at the table:

<FlashCards
  title="Memorize These Common Pot Odds"
  cards={[
    { front: "1/4 Pot Bet (25%)", back: "5:1 odds → Need 17% equity" },
    { front: "1/3 Pot Bet (33%)", back: "4:1 odds → Need 20% equity" },
    { front: "1/2 Pot Bet (50%)", back: "3:1 odds → Need 25% equity" },
    { front: "2/3 Pot Bet (66%)", back: "2.5:1 odds → Need 29% equity" },
    { front: "3/4 Pot Bet (75%)", back: "2.3:1 odds → Need 30% equity" },
    { front: "Pot-Sized Bet (100%)", back: "2:1 odds → Need 33% equity" },
    { front: "1.5x Pot Overbet", back: "1.7:1 odds → Need 37% equity" },
    { front: "2x Pot Overbet", back: "1.5:1 odds → Need 40% equity" }
  ]}
/>

<Exercise
  question="Your opponent bets half the pot. What pot odds are you getting?"
  type="text"
  answer="3:1"
  acceptableAnswers={["3:1", "3 to 1", "3-1", "3 : 1"]}
  hint="Half-pot bet is one of the most common - try to memorize this one"
  explanation="A half-pot bet gives you 3:1 odds (25% equity needed). This is one of the most common bet sizes you'll face."
/>

## The Rule of 2 and 4

Now you know how to calculate pot odds. But how do you know your chances of winning?

When you have a **draw** (like a flush draw or straight draw), you can quickly estimate your equity using the Rule of 2 and 4.

<KeyConcept title="Rule of 2 and 4">
**Rule of 2:** Multiply your outs by 2 for the chance to hit on the next card.

**Rule of 4:** Multiply your outs by 4 for the chance to hit by the river (when facing an all-in on the flop).
</KeyConcept>

### What Are Outs?

**Outs** are cards that will improve your hand to (likely) the best hand.

Common draws and their outs:
- **Flush draw:** 9 outs (13 cards of suit - 4 you can see)
- **Open-ended straight draw (OESD):** 8 outs
- **Gutshot straight draw:** 4 outs
- **Two overcards:** 6 outs (3 of each card)
- **Flush draw + gutshot:** 12 outs (combo draw)

### When to Use Each Rule

<Comparison
  title="Rule of 2 vs Rule of 4"
  left={{
    title: "Use Rule of 2",
    items: [
      "One card to come",
      "Facing a bet on the turn",
      "Opponent likely to bet river too",
      "Multiply outs × 2"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "Use Rule of 4",
    items: [
      "Two cards to come",
      "Facing an all-in on the flop",
      "You'll definitely see both cards",
      "Multiply outs × 4"
    ]
  }}
/>

### Examples

**Flush draw on the turn (one card to come):**
- 9 outs × 2 = 18% chance to hit

**Flush draw on the flop vs all-in (two cards to come):**
- 9 outs × 4 = 36% chance to hit

<Exercise
  question="You have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs) on the turn. Using the Rule of 2, what's your approximate equity?"
  type="number"
  answer={16}
  acceptableRange={[15, 17]}
  unit="%"
  hint="Rule of 2: Outs × 2"
  explanation="8 outs × 2 = 16%. You have about a 16% chance to hit your straight on the river."
/>

<Exercise
  question="You have a flush draw (9 outs) on the flop and face an all-in. Using the Rule of 4, what's your approximate equity?"
  type="number"
  answer={36}
  acceptableRange={[35, 37]}
  unit="%"
  hint="Rule of 4: Outs × 4 (because you'll see both turn and river)"
  explanation="9 outs × 4 = 36%. Since you're seeing two cards, you have about a 36% chance to complete your flush."
/>

## Putting It All Together

Here's the decision-making framework:

<KeyConcept title="The Pot Odds Decision">
1. **Calculate your pot odds** (the price)
2. **Estimate your equity** (your chance to win)
3. **Compare:** If equity > pot odds percentage → **Call**
4. **If equity < pot odds percentage** → **Fold** (unless implied odds justify it)
</KeyConcept>

### Complete Hand Example

<Scenario
  title="Should You Call This River Bet?"
  setup="You have 8♠7♠ on a board of K♠9♠2♦J♣4♥. You missed your flush draw. The pot is $100 and your opponent bets $50. You have 8-high (basically nothing)."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "What are your pot odds?",
      answer: "3:1",
      hint: "Pot after bet = $100 + $50 = $150. You call $50.",
      explanation: "Pot odds = $150 : $50 = 3:1 (or 25%)"
    },
    {
      question: "What is your equity (approximately)?",
      answer: "0%",
      hint: "You have 8-high on a K-J board. Can you win at showdown?",
      explanation: "With 8-high, you have essentially 0% equity. You can only win if opponent is bluffing."
    },
    {
      question: "Do pot odds justify a call? (yes/no)",
      answer: "no",
      hint: "Compare: Is your equity greater than 25%?",
      explanation: "0% equity < 25% needed. This is a clear fold. Pot odds don't justify calling with no chance to win."
    },
    {
      question: "What if you thought opponent bluffs 30% of the time here?",
      answer: "call",
      hint: "If opponent bluffs 30%, your 'equity' is 30% (you win when they're bluffing)",
      explanation: "If you believe opponent bluffs >25% of the time, calling becomes profitable! This is where reads and game theory intersect with pot odds."

## Practice Problems

Let's cement your understanding with some rapid-fire practice:

<MultiExercise
  title="Quick Pot Odds Practice"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "Pot $80, opponent bets $40. Pot odds ratio?",
      answer: "3:1",
      explanation: "Total pot = $120. Odds = $120 : $40 = 3:1"
    },
    {
      question: "Pot $100, opponent bets $100. Pot odds ratio?",
      answer: "2:1",
      explanation: "Total pot = $200. Odds = $200 : $100 = 2:1"
    },
    {
      question: "You have 12 outs on the flop vs all-in. Equity?",
      answer: "48%",
      explanation: "Rule of 4: 12 × 4 = 48%"
    },
    {
      question: "4:1 pot odds. What equity % do you need?",
      answer: "20%",
      explanation: "1 ÷ (4+1) = 1 ÷ 5 = 20%"
    },
    {
      question: "You need 25% equity. Opponent bets half-pot. Call? (yes/no)",
      answer: "yes",
      explanation: "Half-pot = 3:1 = 25% needed. You have exactly 25%. It's break-even, so slightly profitable when you factor in times you might win more."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Add the Bet to the Pot

**Wrong:** Pot is $100, bet is $50, so odds are 100:50 = 2:1
**Right:** Pot is $100 + $50 = $150, so odds are 150:50 = 3:1

Always calculate pot odds based on what you're winning (pot + bet), not just the original pot.

### Mistake 2: Using Rule of 4 When You Shouldn't

Only use Rule of 4 when you're **guaranteed** to see both cards (facing an all-in). If opponent can bet again on the turn, use Rule of 2.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Implied Odds

Pot odds tell you the *immediate* price. But sometimes you can win more money on later streets. This is called **implied odds** - we'll cover this in a future lesson.

### Mistake 4: Counting Outs That Aren't Clean

Not all outs are created equal. If you're drawing to a flush but a flush card also completes an obvious straight for your opponent, that out is "dirty" and less valuable.

## Summary

<KeyConcept title="Key Takeaways">
1. **Pot odds = Pot : Call** — tells you the price you're getting
2. **Rule of 2** — outs × 2 for one card (turn OR river)
3. **Rule of 4** — outs × 4 for two cards (facing all-in on flop)
4. **Call when equity > pot odds percentage**
5. **Memorize common bet sizes** — half-pot = 3:1, pot = 2:1
</KeyConcept>

Pot odds are foundational. Every advanced concept builds on this skill. Practice until these calculations become instant and automatic.
