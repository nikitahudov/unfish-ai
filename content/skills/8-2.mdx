## Introduction

Should you play cash games or tournaments? 6-max or full ring? Online or live?

These aren't trivial questions. The format you choose affects:
- How much you can earn
- How stable your income is
- What skills you need to develop
- How much time you need to invest
- Your overall quality of life as a player

<KeyConcept title="Why Game Selection Matters">
**Not all formats are equal for all players.**

Your results depend on:
- Your personal strengths and weaknesses
- Your variance tolerance
- Your time availability
- Your lifestyle preferences

The best format for you is the one where your edge is largest, your bankroll is adequate, and your lifestyle works.
</KeyConcept>

This module helps you evaluate different formats and choose the one that fits you best.

## Format Overview

Let's understand what each format offers:

<KeyConcept title="The Major Poker Formats">
**Cash Games (6-max):**
Fast-paced, aggressive, deep-stacked. Standard online format. Can sit down and leave anytime.

**Cash Games (Full Ring / 9-max):**
More positional, tighter play, larger edges from position. More common live.

**MTTs (Multi-Table Tournaments):**
Start together, play until one winner. Huge fields, massive variance, potential for big scores.

**SNGs (Sit & Gos):**
Fixed-size tournaments (6-180 players). Start when full. Faster, more structured than MTTs.

**Heads-Up:**
One-on-one format. Very skill-intensive. Fast-paced, high variance.

**Live Poker:**
In-person games. Slower pace, physical tells, generally softer competition.
</KeyConcept>

<Exercise
  question="You have a full-time job and can only play 6-8 hours per week, unpredictably scheduled. Which format fits best?"
  type="text"
  answer="Cash games"
  acceptableAnswers={["Cash games", "cash games", "cash", "Cash"]}
  hint="Which format offers the most flexibility?"
  explanation="Cash games. You can sit down for 30 minutes or 4 hours—whatever fits your schedule. MTTs require committing 4-12 hours per event. Cash games let you play whenever you have time."

## Personal Fit Assessment

Ask yourself these questions to identify your ideal format:

<FlashCards
  title="Self-Assessment Questions"
  cards={[
    { front: "Do I handle variance well emotionally?", back: "If YES → MTTs might work. If NO → Cash games offer more stability." },
    { front: "Can I commit 4-8 hours at a time?", back: "If YES → MTTs are an option. If NO → Cash or SNGs fit better." },
    { front: "Do I need stable monthly income?", back: "If YES → Cash games. If NO → MTTs allow for bigger swings." },
    { front: "Am I strong at short-stack play?", back: "If YES → SNGs and late-stage MTTs. If NO → Cash games (always deep)." },
    { front: "Do I read people well in person?", back: "If YES → Live poker gives huge edge. If NO → Online might be better." },
    { front: "Do I prefer grinding or gambling?", back: "Grinding → Cash games. Gambling excitement → MTTs." },
    { front: "Is poker my primary income?", back: "If YES → Cash games reduce risk. If NO → MTTs okay for higher variance." }
  ]}
/>

### Variance Tolerance

This is critical. Be honest with yourself.

**High variance tolerance:**
- Can handle months of losing while playing well
- Doesn't tilt from bad beats or near-misses
- Has stable non-poker income or large bankroll
- Mentally handles the swings

**Low variance tolerance:**
- Needs regular positive reinforcement
- Gets frustrated during downswings
- Depends on poker income
- Prefers seeing progress session to session

<Exercise
  question="You get very frustrated when you play well but lose, and it affects your future sessions. What does this suggest about format choice?"
  type="text"
  answer="Prefer low-variance formats like cash games"
  acceptableAnswers={["cash games", "low variance", "avoid MTTs", "cash", "lower variance formats"]}
  hint="How do you react to variance?"
  explanation="Low variance tolerance suggests cash games. In MTTs, you can play perfectly and still lose dozens of tournaments due to variance. If that would affect your mental game, cash games' steadier results are better for you."

## Profitability Analysis

Let's look at realistic expectations:

<KeyConcept title="Expected Win Rates by Format">
**Cash Games (online):**
- Recreational: Losing player
- Decent reg: 2-5bb/100
- Strong reg: 5-10bb/100
- Elite: 10-15bb/100 (increasingly rare)

**MTTs:**
- Recreational: -30% to -50% ROI
- Decent player: 10-20% ROI
- Strong player: 20-40% ROI
- Elite: 40-100%+ ROI

**SNGs:**
- Similar to MTTs but slightly lower due to smaller fields
- 5-15% ROI is solid

**Live Cash:**
- Generally 2-3x the win rates of online
- 10-20bb/hr achievable in soft games
</KeyConcept>

### Hourly Rate Calculations

**Cash game example:**
- Playing NL100 at 5bb/100 win rate
- 500 hands/hour (online, 2 tables)
- Win rate: 5 × 500/100 = 25bb = $25/hour

**MTT example:**
- Average buy-in: $20
- 30% ROI (very good)
- 5 tournaments = $100 invested
- Expected profit: $30
- If 5 tourneys take 25 hours: $30/25 = $1.20/hour

**Wait, that can't be right...** Actually, MTT hourly rates are skewed by occasional big scores. A single final table can change your yearly numbers.

<Exercise
  question="You play NL50 online at 6bb/100, averaging 600 hands/hour across 2 tables. What's your approximate hourly win rate?"
  type="number"
  answer={18}
  acceptableRange={[16, 20]}
  unit="$"
  hint="Win rate × hands/hour / 100"
  explanation="6bb/100 × 600 hands/hour / 100 = 36bb/hour. At NL50 (50¢ big blind), 36 × $0.50 = $18/hour."
/>

## Specialization Strategy

<KeyConcept title="The T-Shaped Player">
**Specialize deep, generalize broad.**

- **Deep expertise** in one format (your primary)
- **Broad awareness** of other formats (secondary)

**Benefits of specialization:**
- Mastery comes faster
- Study materials are focused
- Can develop exploitative strategies
- Build reputation in that format

**Dangers of over-specialization:**
- Games dry up or get tougher
- Miss opportunities in other formats
- Skills don't transfer if you need to switch
</KeyConcept>

### How to Choose Your Primary Format

**Step 1:** Assess your current situation (time, bankroll, income needs)

**Step 2:** Take the self-assessment questions honestly

**Step 3:** Try multiple formats (minimum 100 hours each)

**Step 4:** Track results by format

**Step 5:** Evaluate enjoyment AND profitability

**Step 6:** Commit to one primary format for 6-12 months

### When to Diversify

- Your primary format becomes tougher
- You have excess bankroll
- You want to develop new skills
- Your schedule changes
- You're getting bored (burnout prevention)

<Exercise
  question="You've been a cash game player for 2 years. Your games are getting tougher, and you notice MTTs at your site have soft fields. Should you switch completely to MTTs?"
  type="text"
  answer="no - consider adding MTTs while maintaining cash skills"
  acceptableAnswers={["no", "No", "add MTTs", "don't switch completely", "diversify"]}
  hint="Consider the risks of completely changing formats"
  explanation="Don't switch completely. Add MTTs as a secondary format while maintaining your cash skills. Completely abandoning 2 years of cash expertise is risky. Diversify gradually, track results, and adjust."

## Common Game Selection Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Chasing Action

Playing whatever is exciting rather than what's profitable.

**Example:** Jumping into a high-stakes MTT because it's on TV, even though you're not properly rolled.

### Mistake 2: Ego-Driven Selection

Playing formats or stakes for status, not profit.

**Example:** Playing heads-up because it seems like "real poker" even though you're losing.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Variance Tolerance

Choosing high-variance formats when you can't emotionally or financially handle swings.

**Example:** Going pro as an MTT player with only 50 buy-ins and no other income.

### Mistake 4: Format FOMO

Constantly switching between formats, never developing expertise.

**Example:** Playing cash for 2 months, switching to MTTs for 3 months, then SNGs, never mastering any.

### Mistake 5: Not Tracking by Format

Lumping all results together and not knowing which formats are profitable for you.

**Example:** Thinking you're a winning player overall, but actually losing at MTTs and winning at cash.

<Exercise
  question="You play both cash and MTTs but don't track them separately. You're up $500 this year overall. What's the problem?"
  type="text"
  answer="Don't know which format is profitable"
  acceptableAnswers={["don't know which is profitable", "can't evaluate formats", "need to track separately", "might be losing at one"]}
  hint="Can you make good decisions about which to play more?"
  explanation="You might be up $1,500 at cash and down $1,000 at MTTs—but you'd never know. Track separately. You might be wasting time in a format where you're a losing player while neglecting one where you crush."

## Creating Your Game Selection Plan

### Template

**My Current Situation:**
- Available hours per week: ___
- Bankroll: $___
- Income needs from poker: ___
- Variance tolerance: High / Medium / Low

**My Format Assessment:**
- Cash game skill level: ___/10
- MTT skill level: ___/10
- Preferred format for enjoyment: ___
- Preferred format for profit: ___

**My Plan:**
- Primary format: ___
- Weekly hours in primary: ___
- Secondary format (if any): ___
- Weekly hours in secondary: ___
- Review date: ___

<Exercise
  question="Create a game selection plan for this person: 15 hours/week available, $2,000 bankroll, needs stable side income, low variance tolerance."
  type="text"
  answer="Primary: NL25 or NL50 cash games"
  acceptableAnswers={["cash games", "Cash games", "NL50 cash", "NL25 cash", "online cash"]}
  hint="Consider their constraints and tolerance"
  explanation="Primary: NL50 cash games ($2,000 = 40 buy-ins, conservative). Low variance tolerance + income needs = avoid MTTs. 15 hours/week is enough for meaningful cash volume. Focus on steady grinding."

## Practice: Match Player to Format

<MultiExercise
  title="Format Recommendations"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "Player A: Full-time job, 5-6 hours/week, $1,000 bankroll, plays for fun and small profit. Best format?",
      answer: "NL10 or NL25 cash games",
      explanation: "Limited time favors cash (flexible). Small bankroll = low stakes. Playing for fun = don't need MTT variance stress. NL10-25 cash is perfect."
    },
    {
      question: "Player B: Aspiring pro, 40+ hours/week available, $10,000 bankroll, handles variance well, strong math skills. Best format?",
      answer: "Mix of cash (primary) and MTTs (secondary)",
      explanation: "With this bankroll and time, they can develop both. Cash for steady income, MTTs for upside. 30 hours cash, 10 hours MTTs weekly. Strong math skills help both formats."
    },
    {
      question: "Player C: Retired, lots of free time, prefers social environment, strong at reading people. Best format?",
      answer: "Live cash games",
      explanation: "Live cash is perfect: social environment, reading skills are huge advantage, flexible timing, softer competition. The slow pace isn't a downside when you have time."
    },
    {
      question: "Player D: Plays exclusively on mobile during commute, 30 minutes at a time. Best format?",
      answer: "Fast-fold cash (Zoom/Rush) or Spin & Gos",
      explanation: "Short sessions need fast formats. Zoom/Rush cash plays fast and can stop anytime. Spin & Gos take 5-10 minutes. Regular MTTs are impossible with this schedule."
    },
    {
      question: "Player E: Has been grinding NL100 cash profitably for 2 years. Win rate declining as games get tougher. What should they consider?",
      answer: "Move to live poker, try PLO, or add MTTs",
      explanation: "Options: (1) Live cash where competition is softer, (2) Learn PLO where fish-to-reg ratio is better, (3) Add MTTs for field diversity. Don't just keep grinding an increasingly tough game."

## Scenario: Choosing Your Primary Format

<Scenario
  title="The Big Decision"
  setup="You've been playing casually for a year, dabbling in everything. You have a $3,000 bankroll, 15 hours/week to play, and want to get serious. You handle variance decently but prefer some stability. Let's figure out your primary format."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "Your $3,000 bankroll supports which cash stakes? (Using 30 buy-in standard)",
      answer: "NL100",
      hint: "$3,000 / 30 = $100",
      explanation: "NL100. $3,000 / 30 buy-ins = $100 buy-in. You're properly rolled for NL100 cash games."
    },
    {
      question: "You 'handle variance decently but prefer stability.' Does this favor cash or MTTs?",
      answer: "Cash games",
      hint: "Which has more stable results?",
      explanation: "Cash games. 'Prefer stability' is the key phrase. MTT variance can mean losing for months while playing well. Cash games provide more consistent feedback and income."
    },
    {
      question: "With 15 hours/week, you could play ~15 MTTs (averaging 1 hour each, not counting deep runs). Is this enough MTT volume to evaluate your skill?",
      answer: "No - need hundreds to assess MTT skill",
      hint: "How many MTTs for reliable sample?",
      explanation: "No. 15 MTTs/week = 60/month. You'd need 500+ MTTs to reliably assess your edge, which would take 8+ months. Cash game skills are assessable in fewer hours (20k+ hands, doable in a month at 15hrs/week)."
    },
    {
      question: "Based on all factors, what should be your primary format?",
      answer: "NL100 online cash games",
      hint: "Consider bankroll, time, and variance preference",
      explanation: "NL100 online cash games. You're properly rolled, the format suits your schedule, you prefer stability, and you can evaluate your progress in reasonable time. Commit to this for 6 months before reassessing."
    }
  ]}

## Summary

<KeyConcept title="Key Takeaways">
1. **Format choice matters as much as skill** — Match format to your situation
2. **Know your variance tolerance** — Low tolerance = cash games
3. **Time requirements differ** — Cash is flexible, MTTs are not
4. **Specialize first, diversify later** — Master one format before adding others
5. **Track results by format** — Know where your profit comes from
6. **Avoid common mistakes** — Chasing action, ego, FOMO, not tracking
7. **Reassess periodically** — Formats and your situation change over time
8. **Live poker is often softest** — If you can play live, consider it seriously
</KeyConcept>

The format you choose shapes your entire poker experience. Pick wisely, commit fully, and be willing to adjust as you learn more about yourself and the games.
