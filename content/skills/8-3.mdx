## Introduction

How much did you win last month? What's your win rate at NL50? Are you more profitable in the mornings or evenings?

If you can't answer these questions with data, you're flying blind.

<KeyConcept title="Why Track Everything?">
**"What gets measured gets managed."**

Record keeping transforms your poker from a series of random sessions into a business you can analyze and improve.

Without data:
- You rely on biased memory
- You can't identify leaks
- You don't know if you're winning
- You can't set informed goals

With data:
- Objective performance measurement
- Clear leak identification
- Progress tracking over time
- Evidence-based decisions
</KeyConcept>

This module teaches you what to track, how to track it, and how to use your data to improve.

## What to Track

### Essential Financial Data

**Every session, record:**
- Date and time
- Stakes played
- Buy-in amount
- Cash-out amount
- Net result (profit/loss)
- Duration (hours played)
- Number of hands (if online)

**Example session log:**
| Date | Stakes | Buy-in | Cash-out | Result | Hours | Hands |
|------|--------|--------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1/15 | NL50 | $50 | $78 | +$28 | 2.5 | 412 |
| 1/16 | NL50 | $50 | $34 | -$16 | 1.5 | 248 |

### Session Context Data

**Helpful additions:**
- Time of day (morning/afternoon/evening/night)
- Day of week
- Location/site
- Mental state (1-10 focus rating)
- Notes (any notable events)

This context helps identify patterns: "I win more on weekends" or "My focus drops in evening sessions."

<Exercise
  question="You've tracked 50 sessions but only recorded buy-in and cash-out. What important data are you missing?"
  type="text"
  answer="Hours/hands played (can't calculate hourly/per-100 win rates)"
  acceptableAnswers={["hours", "hands", "duration", "time", "can't calculate win rate"]}
  hint="Can you calculate your hourly win rate?"
  explanation="Without hours or hands, you can't calculate win rate (bb/100 or $/hr). Raw profit doesn't tell you if you're efficient. A $500 month is great in 40 hours, terrible in 200 hours."

  cards={[
    { front: "PokerTracker 4", back: "Full tracking + HUD. Imports hand histories, calculates all stats. ~$100. Industry standard for serious players." },
    { front: "Hold'em Manager 3", back: "Similar to PT4. Personal preference which to use. ~$100. Full hand history analysis and HUD." },
    { front: "Hand2Note", back: "Modern alternative. Good free tier. Dynamic HUD features. Growing in popularity." },
    { front: "Spreadsheets (Excel/Sheets)", back: "Free, customizable. Requires manual entry. Good for live players. Templates available online." },
    { front: "Poker Bankroll Tracker", back: "Free mobile app. Simple entry. Good for casual tracking. Lacks detailed analysis." },
    { front: "Primedope", back: "Free online tool. Web-based. Basic tracking. Good for beginners." }
  ]}
/>

### Online vs Live Tracking

**Online:** Use PokerTracker/HM3
- Automatic import of hand histories
- Calculates everything for you
- Generates graphs and reports
- Enables HUD use during play

**Live:** Use spreadsheets or apps
- Manual entry after each session
- Track hours, location, game type
- Add notes about opponents/conditions
- Review weekly/monthly

<Exercise
  question="You primarily play live poker. What's the best tracking approach?"
  type="text"
  answer="Spreadsheet or mobile app with manual entry after each session"
  acceptableAnswers={["spreadsheet", "Spreadsheet", "mobile app", "manual entry", "manual tracking"]}
  hint="Can you import live hand histories?"
  explanation="Spreadsheet or mobile app. Live poker can't be automatically tracked. Enter results immediately after each session (don't wait—you'll forget details). Track hours, game type, and brief notes about game quality."
/>

## Understanding Your Statistics

For online players, tracking software provides dozens of stats. Here are the essential ones:

<KeyConcept title="Core Statistics Explained">
**VPIP (Voluntarily Put $ In Pot):**
How often you voluntarily enter pots. Higher = looser.

**PFR (Pre-Flop Raise):**
How often you raise preflop. Should be close to VPIP for aggressive play.

**3-Bet %:**
How often you 3-bet when facing a raise. 7-10% is standard.

**WTSD (Went to Showdown):**
How often you see showdown when seeing the flop. 25-30% is typical.

**W$SD (Won $ at Showdown):**
How often you win when you reach showdown. 50%+ means you're showdowning strong hands.

**BB/100:**
Big blinds won per 100 hands. Your fundamental win rate metric.
</KeyConcept>

### What Good Stats Look Like (6-Max Online Cash)

| Stat | Weak | Solid | Strong |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| VPIP | Under 18% or Over 32% | 22-28% | 24-26% |
| PFR | Under 15% or Over 28% | 18-24% | 20-23% |
| 3-Bet | Under 5% or Over 14% | 7-10% | 8-9% |
| WTSD | Under 22% or Over 35% | 25-30% | 26-28% |
| W$SD | Under 48% | 50-54% | 52-56% |
| BB/100 | Under 2 | 2-6 | 6-10+ |

### Warning Sign Statistics

**VPIP-PFR gap over 6%:** You're calling too much preflop (passive leak)
**WTSD over 35%:** You're going to showdown too often (calling station tendencies)
**WTSD under 22%:** You're folding too much postflop (weak-tight)
**W$SD under 48%:** You're reaching showdown with weak hands

<Exercise
  question="A player's stats: VPIP 28%, PFR 14%, WTSD 38%. What are their likely leaks?"
  type="text"
  answer="Too passive preflop (large VPIP-PFR gap) and calling down too much (high WTSD)"
  acceptableAnswers={["passive and calling too much", "VPIP-PFR gap", "calling station", "passive preflop, calls too much"]}
  hint="Check the gap and compare WTSD to norms"
  explanation="Two leaks: (1) VPIP-PFR gap of 14% means they're calling way more than raising—passive leak. (2) WTSD of 38% is too high—they're going to showdown with weak hands. They're likely a calling station."

## Data Analysis

Collecting data is step one. Analyzing it is where improvement happens.

### Regular Review Schedule

<KeyConcept title="Review Schedule">
**Daily (2-3 minutes):**
- Log session results
- Rate your mental state
- Note any key hands for later review

**Weekly (15-30 minutes):**
- Calculate weekly profit/loss
- Check win rate trend
- Identify any stat anomalies
- Review 3-5 interesting hands

**Monthly (1-2 hours):**
- Full statistical review
- Compare to previous months
- Identify persistent leaks
- Set goals for next month
- Analyze results by position, time of day, stake

**Quarterly (2-3 hours):**
- Big picture assessment
- Format and stake evaluation
- Long-term trend analysis
- Annual goal progress check
</KeyConcept>

### Leak Identification Process

**Step 1:** Look at your overall BB/100. Is it positive?

**Step 2:** Check stats against norms. Any obvious outliers?

**Step 3:** Break down by position. Are you losing from SB? That's normal. Losing from BTN? Problem.

**Step 4:** Filter by situation. How do you do in 3-bet pots? Facing c-bets?

**Step 5:** Create action items. "My fold-to-3-bet is too low. This month I'll focus on defending correctly."

<Exercise
  question="Your BB/100 at NL50 is 3.5, but your BTN win rate is -2bb/100. What does this suggest?"
  type="text"
  answer="Major leak from the button - should be your most profitable position"
  acceptableAnswers={["button leak", "BTN leak", "problem on button", "button should be profitable"]}
  hint="The button should be your most profitable position"
  explanation="Big leak! The button should be your most profitable position (typically +15 to +30 bb/100). Negative from BTN means you're either playing too tight, not stealing enough, or misplaying postflop when you have position. Investigate immediately."
/>

## Using Data for Improvement

### Setting Data-Driven Goals

**Bad goal:** "Play better"
**Good goal:** "Reduce my WTSD from 34% to 28% over the next month"

Your data shows you exactly what to work on.

### Examples of Data-Driven Improvements

**Observation:** VPIP-PFR gap is 8%
**Action:** Study and implement a more aggressive preflop strategy. Focus on raising rather than calling.

**Observation:** Losing money in the blinds beyond expectation
**Action:** Review blind defense strategy. Either defend wider or tighter based on specific leaks found.

**Observation:** Win rate drops after 2+ hours
**Action:** Implement mandatory breaks or shorten sessions.

**Observation:** Evening sessions are 30% more profitable than morning sessions
**Action:** Shift more volume to evenings.

### Turning Numbers into Action

Every stat that's off should become a study topic:

| Problem Stat | Study Focus |
|--------------|-------------|
| VPIP too high | Preflop hand selection |
| PFR too low | Opening ranges, isolation raises |
| 3-bet too low | 3-betting ranges, defending vs 3-bets |
| WTSD too high | Postflop folding discipline |
| W$SD too low | Value betting, hand reading |
| Losing from BTN | Stealing, postflop IP play |

<Exercise
  question="Your data shows you're winning 4bb/100 overall, but your red line (non-showdown winnings) is -8bb/100. What should you study?"
  type="text"
  answer="Bluffing and aggression - winning too much at showdown, not enough from folds"
  acceptableAnswers={["bluffing", "aggression", "non-showdown winnings", "need to bluff more", "bet more"]}
  hint="Red line = money won without showdown"
  explanation="You need to study bluffing and aggression. Negative red line means you're winning almost entirely at showdown. You're either not bluffing enough, not c-betting enough, or giving up too easily. You're leaving money on the table from folds you should be getting."
/>

## Building the Tracking Habit

<KeyConcept title="Making Tracking Automatic">
**Make it easy:**
- Track immediately after every session (don't wait)
- Use templates and automation where possible
- Keep your tracking tool open during sessions

**Make it consistent:**
- Track every session (even losing ones—especially losing ones)
- Use the same format every time
- Don't skip sessions "just this once"

**Make it meaningful:**
- Actually review your data
- Use it to make decisions
- Celebrate progress you can see in numbers
</KeyConcept>

### Common Tracking Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Only tracking winning sessions
Your data will be useless if you skip losses. Track everything.

**Mistake 2:** Not tracking immediately
Memory is unreliable. Hours later, you'll forget details. Track within minutes of finishing.

**Mistake 3:** Tracking but never reviewing
Data collection without analysis is pointless. Schedule reviews.

**Mistake 4:** Over-complicating
Start simple. You can always add more metrics later. Don't let complexity stop you from tracking at all.

**Mistake 5:** Ignoring context
Results without context are misleading. Track time, mental state, game conditions.

<Exercise
  question="You track all sessions but realize you haven't looked at your data in 3 months. What should you do first?"
  type="text"
  answer="Do a comprehensive review now, then schedule regular reviews"
  acceptableAnswers={["review now", "do a review", "analyze the data", "schedule reviews"]}
  hint="The data exists but isn't being used"
  explanation="Do a comprehensive review now—you have 3 months of insight sitting unused. Then schedule regular reviews (weekly minimum) so this doesn't happen again. Data without analysis is just numbers."

## Practice: Analyze These Stats

<MultiExercise
  title="Stat Analysis Practice"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "Player stats: VPIP 32%, PFR 28%, 3-bet 12%, WTSD 24%, W$SD 58%, BB/100: 2.5. What's their likely play style?",
      answer: "LAG (Loose-Aggressive) - and it's working",
      explanation: "High VPIP (32%) and high PFR (28%) = LAG. Low WTSD (24%) means they're selective about showdowns. High W$SD (58%) means they showdown strong hands. Profitable at 2.5bb/100. This is aggressive, working LAG poker."
    },
    {
      question: "Player stats: VPIP 18%, PFR 16%, 3-bet 6%, WTSD 32%, W$SD 49%, BB/100: 0.5. What leaks do you see?",
      answer: "Going to showdown too often with weak hands (high WTSD, low W$SD)",
      explanation: "Tight preflop (fine), but WTSD of 32% with only 49% W$SD = they're reaching showdown too often with losing hands. They're probably calling too much postflop. They should either call less or showdown stronger hands."
    },
    {
      question: "Your BB/100 by position: UTG +2, MP +3, CO +8, BTN +12, SB -15, BB -8. Which position needs work?",
      answer: "Small blind (-15 is too much)",
      explanation: "SB at -15bb/100 is too much—typically should be -5 to -10. You're either defending too wide, playing too passively from SB, or misplaying postflop OOP. The BB at -8 is normal (you're forced to post). Focus on SB strategy."
    },
    {
      question: "You're profitable at NL25 (4bb/100) but losing at NL50 (-2bb/100) over 30k hands each. What should you do?",
      answer: "Drop to NL25 until you fix NL50 leaks",
      explanation: "30k hands is enough sample to identify a problem. You're a winning NL25 player but losing at NL50. Drop to NL25, study what's different at NL50 (tougher competition, bigger mistakes punished), and only return when you've addressed the leaks."
    },
    {
      question: "Your win rate is 5bb/100 overall, but after filtering by 'session > 3 hours', it drops to 1bb/100. What does this suggest?",
      answer: "Focus/fatigue issues in long sessions - consider shorter sessions",
      explanation: "Clear fatigue pattern. Your edge diminishes dramatically after 3 hours. Either implement mandatory breaks at the 3-hour mark or cap sessions at 2.5 hours. Your 5bb/100 potential is being dragged down by tired play."
    }

## Scenario: Monthly Review Process

<Scenario
  title="The Monthly Analysis"
  setup="It's the first of the month. You have last month's data ready for review. You played NL50 online, 45 hours, 7,500 hands. Let's walk through your monthly analysis."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "Your raw results: +$312 profit. Your hours: 45. What's your hourly rate?",
      answer: "$6.93/hour",
      hint: "Profit / hours",
      explanation: "$312 / 45 hours = $6.93/hour. This is a solid hourly for NL50. But let's dig deeper to see if there are improvements available."
    },
    {
      question: "Your hands: 7,500. Your profit in big blinds: 624bb ($0.50 BB). What's your BB/100?",
      answer: "8.3bb/100",
      hint: "(Profit in BB / hands) × 100",
      explanation: "624bb / 7,500 hands × 100 = 8.32bb/100. Excellent win rate—well above the 5bb/100 solid threshold. But is this sustainable or did you run good?"
    },
    {
      question: "Your tracking software shows your EV-adjusted BB/100 is 5.2bb/100 (you ran 3.1bb/100 above expectation). What does this tell you?",
      answer: "You ran good - true win rate is likely closer to 5.2bb/100",
      hint: "What does EV-adjusted mean?",
      explanation: "You ran above EV by 3.1bb/100—meaning luck inflated your results. Your actual playing performance (EV-adjusted) is 5.2bb/100. Still very good! But don't expect 8.3bb/100 to continue. Budget for 5bb/100."
    },
    {
      question: "Your VPIP is 31% and your VTSD is 36%. Both are higher than optimal (24-28% VPIP, 25-30% WTSD). What action items should you set?",
      answer: "Tighten preflop (lower VPIP) and fold more postflop (lower WTSD)",
      hint: "Both stats are too high",
      explanation: "Two action items: (1) Tighten preflop—31% VPIP is too loose for 6-max. Review your opening ranges, especially from early positions. (2) Fold more postflop—36% WTSD means you're calling too much. Practice folding marginal hands."
    }
  ]}
