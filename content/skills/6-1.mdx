## Introduction

You've been playing well all session. Then it happens: you get your aces cracked by someone who called three bets with 7♣4♣ and rivered a flush. Suddenly, you're calling too wide, bluffing too much, and playing hands you know you shouldn't.

You're on **tilt**.

<KeyConcept title="What Is Tilt?">
**Tilt** is an emotional state that negatively affects your decision-making at the poker table.

When tilted, you stop making decisions based on logic and start making decisions based on emotion—frustration, anger, desperation, or even excessive confidence.

**Tilt is the single biggest leak for most poker players.** One bad session on tilt can erase weeks of steady profit.
</KeyConcept>

The good news? Tilt is manageable. You can learn to recognize it, prevent it, and recover from it. This module gives you the tools.

## Why Everyone Tilts

Before we go further, let's normalize this: **every poker player tilts**. Even the best players in the world experience tilt. The difference is how they manage it.

**Why tilt is universal:**
- Poker involves real money and real losses
- Variance can be brutal and feel unfair
- We're emotionally invested in outcomes
- Our brains aren't wired for probability

**The goal isn't to eliminate tilt—it's to:**
1. Recognize it quickly
2. Minimize its impact
3. Recover faster

<Exercise
  question="True or false: Professional poker players never tilt."
  type="text"
  answer="false"
  acceptableAnswers={["false", "False", "FALSE"]}
  hint="Think about what you've read so far"
  explanation="False. All poker players tilt, including professionals. The difference is that pros recognize tilt quickly and have systems to minimize its impact. Tilt management is a skill, not an immunity."
/>

## Types of Tilt

Tilt isn't one-size-fits-all. Different triggers create different types of tilt:

<KeyConcept title="The Six Types of Tilt">
1. **Bad Beat Tilt:** You lost a pot you "should have" won
2. **Entitlement Tilt:** "I deserve to win, I played perfectly"
3. **Injustice Tilt:** "This isn't fair" (repeated bad luck)
4. **Winner's Tilt:** Playing loose after winning big
5. **Mistake Tilt:** Angry at yourself for making an error
6. **Revenge Tilt:** Wanting to get even with a specific player

Understanding your tilt type helps you address the root cause.
</KeyConcept>

### Bad Beat Tilt

The classic. You had them crushed, they hit a two-outer, and now you're furious.

**The reality:** This is poker working exactly as it should. You want bad players to call with terrible hands. Sometimes they'll hit. That's the source of your long-term profit.

### Entitlement Tilt

"I played this hand perfectly and still lost." You feel you deserve a different result because you made the right decision.

**The reality:** Good decisions don't guarantee good outcomes in the short term. Poker rewards correct play over thousands of hands, not individual hands.

### Winner's Tilt

You're up big and feeling invincible. You start playing loose, taking unnecessary risks, and giving back your winnings.

**The reality:** Your skill level doesn't change based on your chip stack. Stay disciplined whether winning or losing.

<Exercise
  question="You played a pot perfectly but lost to a one-outer on the river. You keep thinking 'I deserved to win that.' What type of tilt is this?"
  type="text"
  answer="Entitlement Tilt"
  acceptableAnswers={["Entitlement Tilt", "entitlement tilt", "entitlement", "Entitlement"]}
  hint="You feel you deserve a certain outcome"
  explanation="Entitlement Tilt. The belief that you 'deserve' to win because you played correctly is entitlement thinking. You deserve to make the right decision—outcome is variance."
/>

## Identifying Your Triggers

Everyone has different tilt triggers. Knowing yours is the first step to managing them.

### Common Tilt Triggers

**External triggers:**
- Bad beats
- Rude opponents
- Losing to specific player types (calling stations, maniacs)
- Running below EV
- Internet connection issues
- Distractions

**Internal triggers:**
- Fatigue
- Hunger
- Stress from life events
- Unrealistic expectations
- Impatience
- Self-doubt

### Self-Reflection Exercise

Take a moment to honestly answer: **What tilts you the most?**

Think about your last few tilting episodes:
- What happened right before you tilted?
- Was there a common theme?
- Were you already in a vulnerable state?

<Exercise
  question="Reflect: What's your #1 tilt trigger? Be honest with yourself."
  type="text"
  answer="(personal reflection)"
  acceptableAnswers={["bad beats", "losing", "mistakes", "calling stations", "variance", "running bad", "self-reflection", "personal answer"]}
  hint="There's no wrong answer—this is about self-awareness"
  explanation="Whatever your answer, awareness is the first step. Knowing your triggers allows you to prepare for them and recognize when you're vulnerable."
/>

## Early Warning Signs

Tilt doesn't hit like a switch—it builds gradually. Catching it early is crucial.

<FlashCards
  title="Early Warning Signs of Tilt"
  cards={[
    { front: "Physical Signs", back: "Increased heart rate, muscle tension, shallow breathing, clenched jaw, sweating, feeling hot" },
    { front: "Emotional Signs", back: "Frustration, anger, irritability, hopelessness, desperation, feeling 'unlucky'" },
    { front: "Behavioral Signs", back: "Playing faster, not thinking through decisions, calling too quickly, checking phone angrily" },
    { front: "Decision Signs", back: "Calling when you should fold, bluffing too much, revenge raising, playing too many hands" },
    { front: "Thought Patterns", back: "\"This is unfair,\" \"I deserve to win,\" \"I need to get even,\" \"Just one more hand\"" },
    { front: "The 'Whatever' Feeling", back: "Apathy about decisions, clicking buttons without thinking, not caring about the outcome" }
  ]}
/>

### The Tilt Scale

Rate your tilt from 1-10:

| Level | Description | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-3 | Mild frustration, slightly annoyed | Acknowledge it, continue playing |
| 4-6 | Noticeable impact on decisions | Take a 5-10 minute break |
| 7-8 | Significant impairment | End the session soon |
| 9-10 | Severe tilt, completely compromised | End session immediately |

<Exercise
  question="You've lost 3 buy-ins. You notice your heart rate is up, you're making decisions faster, and you feel like you 'need' to win the next hand. What's your tilt level approximately?"
  type="number"
  answer={6}
  acceptableRange={[5, 7]}
  hint="Multiple warning signs are present"
  explanation="Around 5-7. You're showing physical signs (heart rate), behavioral signs (fast decisions), and thought patterns ('need' to win). This is moderate tilt—take a break before it escalates."
/>

---

## Prevention Strategies

The best tilt management is prevention. Set yourself up for success before you play.

<KeyConcept title="Pre-Session Prevention">
**Physical preparation:**
- Get adequate sleep (7-8 hours)
- Eat a proper meal (avoid playing hungry)
- Avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol

**Mental preparation:**
- Clear your mind of life stressors
- Set realistic expectations
- Review your goals for the session
- Accept that variance will happen

**Environmental preparation:**
- Remove distractions (phone away)
- Create a comfortable space
- Have water nearby
</KeyConcept>

### Stop-Loss Rules

A **stop-loss** is a predetermined point at which you'll quit the session, no matter what.

**Examples:**
- "I'll quit if I lose 3 buy-ins"
- "I'll quit if I notice tilt signs at level 5+"
- "I'll quit after 2 hours regardless of results"

**Why stop-losses work:**
- Decision made in advance (not during tilt)
- Removes "just one more hand" temptation
- Protects your bankroll

<Exercise
  question="You decide before a session: 'I'll quit if I lose 3 buy-ins.' After losing exactly 3 buy-ins, you think 'But I'm playing well, the cards will turn around.' Should you keep playing?"
  type="text"
  answer="no"
  acceptableAnswers={["no", "No", "NO", "quit", "stop"]}
  hint="What was your pre-session commitment?"
  explanation="No. Stop-losses only work if you follow them. The thoughts you're having ('cards will turn around') are classic tilt thoughts. Honor your commitment. The games will be there tomorrow."
/>

## Recovery Protocols

Despite your best efforts, you'll sometimes find yourself tilting. Here's how to recover:

### Immediate Actions (When You Notice Tilt)

**1. The 10-Breath Technique**
- Pause before your next action
- Take 10 slow, deep breaths
- Focus only on your breathing
- Reassess your emotional state

**2. Physical Movement**
- Stand up and stretch
- Walk around for 2 minutes
- Get fresh air if possible
- Change your physical state

**3. Verbal Reset**
- Say out loud (or silently): "This is just one hand"
- Remind yourself: "Variance is part of poker"
- Reaffirm: "I play for long-term profit"

      "Drinking alcohol",
      "Aggressive chat/berating players",
      "Playing more tables",
      "Ignoring the warning signs"
    ]
  }}
/>

### Session Termination Criteria

Know when to quit. End your session if:
- You've hit your stop-loss
- Tilt level reaches 7+
- You can't focus on correct decisions
- You're playing to get even, not to play well
- Physical fatigue is significant

<Exercise
  question="You're tilting but there's a very bad player at your table. You think 'I can't leave, this is too good.' What should you do?"
  type="text"
  answer="leave anyway"
  acceptableAnswers={["leave anyway", "leave", "quit", "still leave", "end session"]}
  hint="How well can you exploit them while tilted?"
  explanation="Leave anyway. A fish will always be somewhere. But playing tilted against even a bad player can lose you more than you'd win playing well. The 'too good to leave' thought is often a rationalization for staying on tilt."
/>

## Long-Term Tilt Management

Beyond session-by-session tactics, build long-term resilience:

### Reframe Bad Beats

Instead of: "I can't believe they called with that garbage!"

Try: "Good. I want them calling with that. I'm printing money long-term."

**The math reality:** If someone calls your AA all-in with 74o, you're making massive profit. They'll hit sometimes—that's the cost of doing business. Without these players, poker wouldn't be profitable.

### Accept Variance Emotionally

You might understand variance intellectually but still feel victimized by it. Bridge this gap:

- Review your hands over large samples (1000+ hands)
- See how results converge to expectation
- Remember: this hand is one of millions you'll play
- Your edge plays out over time, not individual hands

### The "Zoom Out" Technique

When a bad beat hits, mentally zoom out:
- This hand is 1 of 100 today
- Today is 1 of 30 this month
- This month is 1 of 12 this year
- This year is 1 of many in your poker career

**One hand doesn't matter.**

<Exercise
  question="You get your money in good with 80% equity and lose. You understand this happens 20% of the time, but you still feel angry. Is this normal?"
  type="text"
  answer="yes"
  acceptableAnswers={["yes", "Yes", "YES", "normal"]}
  hint="There's a difference between knowing and feeling"
  explanation="Yes, completely normal. Intellectual understanding and emotional acceptance are different things. It's okay to feel frustrated—the goal is to not let that feeling affect your decisions. Acknowledge the emotion, then let it pass."
/>

## Practice: Tilt Scenarios

<MultiExercise
  title="What Type of Tilt? What Should You Do?"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "You lose AA vs KK all-in preflop. You feel your blood pressure rise and think 'I'm so unlucky.' Type of tilt and action?",
      answer: "Bad Beat Tilt - take a short break",
      explanation: "Bad Beat Tilt. You lost a standard cooler—both players were playing correctly. Take a 5-minute break, use the breathing technique, remind yourself this is normal variance."
    },
    {
      question: "You've won $500 and feel unstoppable. You start playing 74s from UTG because 'I can't lose today.' Type of tilt and action?",
      answer: "Winner's Tilt - return to normal strategy",
      explanation: "Winner's Tilt. Winning doesn't change correct strategy. You're playing hands outside your range due to overconfidence. Return to your standard ranges immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "A specific player has beaten you in three big pots. You find yourself targeting them with bluffs to 'get even.' Type of tilt and action?",
      answer: "Revenge Tilt - stop targeting, play normal",
      explanation: "Revenge Tilt. You're making plays based on emotion toward a specific player, not based on correct strategy. Reset: they're just another opponent. Play your normal game."
    },
    {
      question: "You made a bad call and lost a pot. You keep replaying the hand, angry at yourself for the mistake. Type of tilt and action?",
      answer: "Mistake Tilt - accept it, note for later review",
      explanation: "Mistake Tilt. Self-criticism during a session is unproductive. Note the hand to review later. For now, accept that everyone makes mistakes, and focus on the next decision."
    },
    {
      question: "You've lost 4 buy-ins in 30 minutes despite playing well. You think 'the universe is against me.' Tilt level and action?",
      answer: "7-8, end session",
      explanation: "Tilt level 7-8 (Injustice Tilt). Four buy-ins in 30 minutes is brutal variance. The 'universe against me' thought pattern signals significant tilt. End the session, protect your bankroll, come back tomorrow."
    }
  ]}

## Scenario: Managing a Downswing Session

<Scenario
  title="When Everything Goes Wrong"
  setup="You're 90 minutes into a session. You've lost 2.5 buy-ins despite playing what feels like good poker. Let's walk through the decision process."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "You notice you're breathing faster and your jaw is tight. You're thinking 'This is ridiculous.' What's your approximate tilt level?",
      answer: "4-5",
      hint: "Physical signs present, negative thought patterns emerging",
      explanation: "Around 4-5. You have physical symptoms (breathing, jaw) and negative thoughts. This is moderate tilt—not severe yet, but requires attention before it escalates."
    },
    {
      question: "Your pre-session stop-loss was 3 buy-ins. You're at 2.5 buy-ins. A fish sits down at your table. What should you do?",
      answer: "Continue but with heightened awareness",
      hint: "You haven't hit your stop-loss yet",
      explanation: "You can continue—you haven't hit your stop-loss. BUT: increase your self-monitoring. You're in vulnerable territory. If you lose the next half buy-in OR tilt symptoms worsen, leave."
    },
    {
      question: "You lose another pot and catch yourself thinking 'I need to win this next one.' What specific tilt type is this?",
      answer: "Desperation/get-even tilt",
      hint: "The word 'need' is the key",
      explanation: "'Need to win' is desperation/get-even thinking. You don't 'need' anything in poker—you make good decisions and let results happen. This thought pattern is a red flag."
    },
    {
      question: "Given the escalation, what's the correct action now?",
      answer: "End the session",
      hint: "Consider: stop-loss proximity, tilt escalation, thought patterns",
      explanation: "End the session. You're at 2.5 of 3 buy-in stop-loss, tilt is escalating (now around 6-7), and you're having desperation thoughts. The criteria for ending are met. Leave, preserve your bankroll, return tomorrow."
    }
  ]}
/>
