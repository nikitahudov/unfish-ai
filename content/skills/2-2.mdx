## Introduction

If there's one concept that separates poker from other card games, it's **position**. In blackjack, your seat doesn't matter. In poker, it's everything.

Position refers to where you sit relative to the dealer button and, more importantly, when you act during a hand. Acting last is a massive advantage—you get to see what everyone else does before making your decision.

<KeyConcept title="The Power of Position">
**Position is so valuable that professional players often say:**

"I'd rather have a mediocre hand in position than a good hand out of position."

This isn't hyperbole. Data shows that the button (best position) has win rates 2-3x higher than the blinds.
</KeyConcept>

In this module, you'll learn every table position, understand why acting last is so powerful, and discover how to adjust your strategy based on where you're sitting.

## Table Positions Explained

### 9-Max (Full Ring) Positions

At a full 9-player table, positions are named from earliest to latest:

| Position | Abbreviation | Category |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Under the Gun | UTG | Early |
| Under the Gun +1 | UTG+1 | Early |
| Under the Gun +2 | UTG+2 | Early |
| Middle Position | MP | Middle |
| Middle Position +1 | MP+1 | Middle |
| Hijack | HJ | Late |
| Cutoff | CO | Late |
| Button | BTN | Late |
| Small Blind | SB | Blinds |
| Big Blind | BB | Blinds |

### 6-Max Positions

At a 6-player table (more common online), positions compress:

| Position | Abbreviation | Category |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Under the Gun | UTG | Early |
| Middle Position | MP | Middle |
| Hijack | HJ | Late |
| Cutoff | CO | Late |
| Button | BTN | Late |
| Small Blind | SB | Blinds |
| Big Blind | BB | Blinds |

<Exercise
  question="In a 6-max game, which position acts first preflop?"
  type="text"
  answer="UTG"
  acceptableAnswers={["UTG", "utg", "under the gun", "Under the Gun"]}
  hint="The earliest position in 6-max..."
  explanation="UTG (Under the Gun) acts first preflop in 6-max. The action moves clockwise from there."
/>

<Exercise
  question="In a 6-max game, which position acts last preflop (before the blinds respond)?"
  type="text"
  answer="Button"
  acceptableAnswers={["Button", "button", "BTN", "btn"]}
  hint="This is the most profitable position..."
  explanation="The Button acts last preflop (besides the blinds when facing a raise). Postflop, the button ALWAYS acts last, which is why it's the best seat."
/>

## Why Position Matters

Position provides four key advantages:

### 1. Information Advantage

When you act last, you see what your opponents do before deciding. Did they check (showing weakness)? Bet small? Bet big? You get to use this information; they don't get to use yours.

<KeyConcept title="Information = Money">
Every piece of information has value. If your opponent checks and you hold a marginal hand:

- **In position:** You can check back for a free card or value bet thinly
- **Out of position:** You have to act first, often guessing wrong
</KeyConcept>

### 2. Pot Control

When you're in position, you control the size of the pot much more easily:

- Want to keep the pot small with a medium-strength hand? Check behind.
- Want to build the pot with a strong hand? Bet.

Out of position, you either bet and risk raises or check and give free cards.

### 3. Bluffing Credibility

Bluffs from the button are more believable than bluffs from early position. Why?

- You could have any hand (wide range)
- You've seen everyone check (showing weakness)
- Your story makes sense

<Exercise
  question="You're on the button. Everyone checks to you on the river. Is this a good spot to bluff?"
  type="text"
  answer="yes"
  acceptableAnswers={["yes", "Yes", "YES"]}
  hint="Think about the information you've gathered..."
  explanation="Yes! When everyone checks to you on the river, they've shown weakness. Your bluff has high credibility because: (1) they've demonstrated they don't have a strong hand, and (2) you could have been slow-playing anything."
/>

### 4. Equity Realization

Remember realized equity from Module 1.2? Position is the biggest factor in how much of your theoretical equity you actually capture.

**Example:** You have 7♠6♠ vs. A♦K♦ — roughly 40% equity.

- **In position:** You can see cheap turns, control pot size, and fold when you miss
- **Out of position:** You face bets when you miss, can't control sizing, and often fold too early or pay too much

In position, you might realize 90%+ of your 40% equity. Out of position, maybe only 60%.

## Position Statistics

Data from millions of online hands proves position's importance:

<FlashCards
  title="Average Win Rates by Position (bb/100 hands)"
  cards={[
    { front: "Button (BTN)", back: "+25 to +35 bb/100 — Most profitable seat" },
    { front: "Cutoff (CO)", back: "+15 to +25 bb/100 — Second most profitable" },
    { front: "Hijack (HJ)", back: "+5 to +15 bb/100 — Still solidly profitable" },
    { front: "Middle Position", back: "+2 to +8 bb/100 — Modest profit" },
    { front: "UTG / Early", back: "+0 to +5 bb/100 — Break-even to small profit" },
    { front: "Small Blind (SB)", back: "-15 to -25 bb/100 — Worst seat" },
    { front: "Big Blind (BB)", back: "-10 to -20 bb/100 — Forced money in" }
  ]}
/>

Notice the pattern: profit increases as position improves. The button can be 10x more profitable than UTG. This isn't coincidence—it's the power of acting last.

<Exercise
  question="Which position has the WORST expected win rate?"
  type="text"
  answer="Small Blind"
  acceptableAnswers={["Small Blind", "small blind", "SB", "sb"]}
  hint="This position has worst postflop position AND has to post money preflop..."
  explanation="The Small Blind is the worst position. You're forced to put money in blind, and you'll be out of position to everyone except the BB for the entire hand."
/>

## Position-Based Hand Selection

Your starting hand requirements should change dramatically based on position. From Module 2.1, you learned hand categories. Here's how to apply them by position:

<Comparison
  title="Hand Ranges by Position"
  left={{
    title: "Early Position (UTG)",
    items: [
      "Only ~12-15% of hands",
      "Premium and strong hands",
      "AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQs",
      "NO speculative hands",
      "NO trouble hands"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "Button (BTN)",
    items: [
      "Up to ~40-50% of hands",
      "All playable hands",
      "Add suited connectors, suited gappers",
      "Small pairs for set-mining",
      "Even some trouble hands"
    ]
  }}
/>

### Why Can You Play More on the Button?

1. **Fewer players to act:** Only the blinds remain. Less chance someone has a strong hand.
2. **Guaranteed position:** You'll act last on every postflop street.
3. **Stealing opportunity:** Blinds fold often, awarding you dead money.

### Position-Based Opening Percentages

| Position | Approximate Opening Range |
|----------|--------------------------|
| UTG | 12-15% |
| UTG+1 | 14-16% |
| MP | 16-20% |
| HJ | 20-25% |
| CO | 25-32% |
| BTN | 40-50% |
| SB | 35-45% (vs BB only) |

<Exercise
  question="From the cutoff, should you play a wider or narrower range than from UTG?"
  type="text"
  answer="wider"
  acceptableAnswers={["wider", "Wider", "WIDER"]}
  hint="CO has much better position than UTG..."
  explanation="Much wider! The CO plays roughly 25-32% of hands vs UTG's 12-15%. Better position = more hands profitable to play."
/>

## Relative Position

There's another layer to position: your position **relative to the preflop aggressor**.

<KeyConcept title="Relative Position">
**Absolute position:** Where you sit relative to the button.

**Relative position:** Where you sit relative to the player who has betting lead (usually the preflop raiser).

Acting AFTER the aggressor is valuable because you see what they do before acting.
</KeyConcept>

### Example: The Sandwich

You're in the small blind. UTG raises, you call, and the big blind calls.

On the flop, the action goes: **You → BB → UTG raiser**

This is terrible relative position! You have to act first, but the person with the betting lead (UTG) acts last. You're "sandwiched"—whatever you do, UTG can punish you.

Compare this to being on the button with the same three players. Now you act AFTER UTG, seeing what they do before deciding.

<Exercise
  question="The cutoff raises and the button calls. You're in the big blind. Who has the best relative position postflop?"
  type="text"
  answer="Button"
  acceptableAnswers={["Button", "button", "BTN", "btn"]}
  hint="Who acts after the preflop raiser?"
  explanation="The Button has the best relative position. They act after the cutoff (the preflop raiser) on every street, gaining maximum information before deciding."
/>

---

## Playing from the Blinds

The blinds are unique: you're forced to put money in, but you have terrible position postflop.

### Small Blind Problems

The small blind is the worst seat because:
1. You post 0.5bb without seeing cards (forced investment)
2. You're out of position to everyone except the BB
3. You're last to act preflop but first to act postflop

**Strategy:** Play tighter than you think. Many players defend the small blind way too wide.

### Big Blind Considerations

The big blind is slightly better because:
1. You close the action preflop (can see everyone's decision)
2. You're getting a discount (already posted 1bb)
3. Pot odds often justify wider calls

**Big Blind Defense Math:**

If everyone folds to the button who raises to 2.5bb, you need to call 1.5bb to win 4bb (2.5 + 0.5 + 1).
- Pot odds: 4:1.5 = 2.67:1
- Required equity: 27%

Many hands have 27% equity against a wide button range, making wide big blind defense correct.

<KeyConcept title="Blind Defense Balance">
**Don't defend blinds too tight:** You're getting good pot odds; folding too much bleeds chips.

**Don't defend too wide:** Being out of position is costly. You'll make postflop mistakes that eat into your pot odds advantage.

Find the balance—defend with playable hands that can navigate postflop.
</KeyConcept>

<Exercise
  question="You're in the big blind. The button min-raises to 2bb, SB folds. You need to call 1bb to win 3.5bb. What pot odds are you getting?"
  type="text"
  answer="3.5:1"
  acceptableAnswers={["3.5:1", "3.5 to 1", "3.5-1"]}
  hint="Pot = 2bb + 0.5bb + 1bb = 3.5bb. You call 1bb."
  explanation="You're getting 3.5:1 odds (1bb to win 3.5bb). This means you only need ~22% equity to break even, justifying calls with a wide range of hands."
/>

## Exploiting Position

Understanding position lets you exploit opponents who ignore it.

### Against Players in Early Position

Early position raisers have strong ranges (they SHOULD, anyway). Respect their bets and tighten your calling range.

### Against Players in Late Position

Late position raisers might have anything. You can 3-bet more liberally for value or as a bluff.

### When You Have Position

- **Bet more draws:** You can take free cards when you miss
- **Value bet thinner:** Easier to fold to raises
- **Bluff more rivers:** Your story is more credible

### When Out of Position

- **Play tighter ranges:** You need stronger hands to compensate
- **Check-raise more:** It's your main way to build pots and protect
- **Give up more often:** Being OOP and weak is losing poker

<Exercise
  question="You're in position with a medium-strength hand. Opponent checks. Should you usually bet or check?"
  type="text"
  answer="it depends"
  acceptableAnswers={["it depends", "depends", "Depends", "It depends", "both can be correct", "situational"]}
  hint="There's no universal answer—what factors matter?"
  explanation="It depends! With a medium hand in position, both options are viable. Checking takes a free card and pot controls. Betting gets value from worse hands but risks raises. Consider board texture, opponent tendencies, and stack depth."
/>

## Common Positional Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Playing Too Many Hands from EP

"But AJo is a good hand!" Not from UTG it isn't. When 8 players act behind you, someone likely has you dominated.

### Mistake 2: Not Widening Enough on the Button

Folding 98s on the button because "it's not premium" throws away profit. You have every advantage; use it.

### Mistake 3: Over-Defending Blinds

"But I already have money in!" Sunk cost fallacy. Bad pot odds with Q5o are still bad, even if you posted a blind.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Relative Position

Calling a raise with the original raiser still to act is dangerous. You'll be sandwiched if they continue.

### Mistake 5: Playing OOP as if You're IP

Out of position, you should be checking more, betting smaller, and folding more. You can't play the same strategy from everywhere.

## Practice Problems

<MultiExercise
  title="Position Recognition Practice"
  exercises={[
    {
      question: "In 6-max, how many positions are considered 'late position'?",
      answer: "3",
      explanation: "Hijack, Cutoff, and Button are late position (sometimes HJ is grouped as middle). These are the profitable stealing positions."
    },
    {
      question: "You're on the button with K8s. UTG raises. Is cold-calling a good play?",
      answer: "Usually fold",
      explanation: "Usually fold. K8s doesn't play well against an UTG opening range (which is tight). You'll be dominated by Kx hands and can't realize your equity well enough."
    },
    {
      question: "The cutoff opens, you 3-bet from the button, CO calls. Who has position postflop?",
      answer: "Button",
      explanation: "You (Button) have position. You'll act last on every postflop street, giving you maximum information advantage."
    },
    {
      question: "Should you play more hands from the SB or the BB?",
      answer: "BB",
      explanation: "BB plays more hands because: (1) you get a discount (already posted 1bb), (2) you close the preflop action, and (3) you're only OOP to one player (vs SB being OOP to everyone)."
    },
    {
      question: "What percentage of hands should you roughly open from UTG in 6-max?",
      answer: "12-15%",
      explanation: "About 12-15%. This includes premiums (AA-TT), strong broadways (AK, AQ, AJ), and a few other strong hands. No speculative hands from EP."
    }

## Scenario: Position-Based Decision

<Scenario
  title="Adjusting for Position"
  setup="You're playing 6-max online, 100bb deep. The same hand—J♥T♥—comes up in different positions. Consider how position changes your decision."
  steps={[
    {
      question: "You're UTG with J♥T♥. Everyone has folded to you. Should you raise, limp, or fold?",
      answer: "fold",
      hint: "JTs is a nice hand, but UTG is the tightest position...",
      explanation: "Fold. JTs is too weak to open from UTG in most games. You'll face overcards often, and 5 players behind could wake up with better hands. In aggressive games with 3-bettors behind, this is definitely a fold."
    },
    {
      question: "You're in the Hijack with J♥T♥. Everyone folds to you. Raise, limp, or fold?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "HJ is late position with only 3 players behind...",
      explanation: "Raise! From the HJ with only CO, BTN, and blinds behind, JTs becomes playable. You have reasonable equity if called and can take down the blinds uncontested often."
    },
    {
      question: "You're on the Button with J♥T♥. Everyone folds to you. Raise, limp, or fold?",
      answer: "raise",
      hint: "The button is the best position...",
      explanation: "Definitely raise! JTs is a clear open from the button. You have position on the blinds, great playability postflop, and steal equity. This is one of the most profitable spots in poker."
    },
    {
      question: "You're in the Big Blind with J♥T♥. Button raises to 2.5bb, SB folds. Raise (3-bet), call, or fold?",
      answer: "call",
      hint: "Consider your pot odds and JTs's playability...",
      explanation: "Call. You're getting 3.5:1 pot odds and JTs has excellent postflop playability with straight and flush potential. 3-betting turns your hand into a bluff (which can work), but calling to see a flop is the standard play here."
    }
  ]}
/>
